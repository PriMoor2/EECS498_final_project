    "Reason": "This is an unusual situation where both the affirmative and negative sides have reached complete agreement. The affirmative side presented a mathematically sound solution: starting with 1000 kg of apples (90% water = 900 kg water, 10% solids = 100 kg solids), and recognizing that only water evaporates while solids remain constant. When water content drops to 80%, the solids (100 kg) now represent 20% of the total weight, yielding a final weight of 500 kg. The negative side, despite being positioned to argue against, actually verified and confirmed the affirmative's calculation as completely correct. Both sides demonstrated high confidence and provided identical mathematical reasoning with proper verification (500 kg × 80% = 400 kg water, 500 kg × 20% = 100 kg solids).
