    "base_answer": "I need to find what percentage of the total adult population is married.\n\nLet me denote:\n- W = number of women in the town\n- M = number of men in the town\n\nGiven information:\n- 60% of women are married: 0.6W married women\n- 80% of men are married: 0.8M married men\n\nKey insight: In a heterosexual marriage model, the number of married women equals the number of married men (each marriage consists of one woman and one man).\n\nTherefore:\n0.6W = 0.8M\n\nSolving for the ratio of women to men:\n0.6W = 0.8M\nW/M = 0.8/0.6 = 4/3\n\nSo for every 4 women, there are 3 men.\n\nLet me use concrete numbers: W = 4 and M = 3\n\nThen:\n- Married women = 0.6 × 4 = 2.4\n- Married men = 0.8 × 3 = 2.4 ✓ (This checks out)\n\nTotal married people = 2.4 + 2.4 = 4.8\nTotal adult population = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nPercentage married = 4.8/7 = 48/70 = 24/35 ≈ 68.57%\n\nTherefore, approximately **68.6%** (or exactly 24/35) of the total adult population is married.",
    "debate_answer": "68.57% (or exactly 48/7 × 100%) of the total adult population is married",
    "Reason": "Both debaters ultimately arrived at the same answer of 68.57% (or 48/7 × 100%). The Affirmative side presented a clear, systematic solution from the start. The Negative side initially raised a concern about double-counting but then self-corrected, acknowledging that the Affirmative's approach was correct. The key insight both agreed upon is that when counting married people, we count individuals (both married women AND married men), not marriages. Since 0.6W = 0.8M = 2.4k, and we have 2.4k married women plus 2.4k married men, that gives us 4.8k married individuals out of 7k total adults, yielding 4.8/7 ≈ 68.57%. The Affirmative side maintained consistency and accuracy throughout, while the Negative side's self-correction actually validates the Affirmative's original answer.",
