    "Reason": "Both the affirmative and negative sides agree on the answer of 15 hours. The affirmative side presented a clear, methodical solution using the distance equation approach, setting up the problem correctly with the 225-mile head start and solving for when both trains have traveled equal distances. The negative side confirmed this answer and even provided an alternative verification using the relative speed method (15 mph closing speed). Since both sides are in complete agreement and the mathematical solution is correct and well-verified, the affirmative side is supported as they presented the original correct solution.",
