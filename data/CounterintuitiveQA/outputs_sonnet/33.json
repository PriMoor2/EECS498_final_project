    "debate_answer": "The optimal strategy for the Secretary Problem with 100 candidates is: (1) Reject the first 37 candidates automatically while observing their quality, (2) Starting from candidate 38, select the first candidate who ranks better than ALL previously interviewed candidates, (3) If no such candidate appears by the end, accept the last candidate. This strategy yields a success probability of approximately 37.1% (or 1/e ≈ 0.3679), which is the maximum achievable probability for selecting the best candidate.",
    "Reason": "Both debaters correctly identify this as the Secretary Problem and agree on the fundamental strategy of rejecting the first r ≈ 37 candidates and then selecting strategically. However, the Negative side makes a crucial clarification that the Affirmative side's explanation was ambiguous about. The Affirmative states 'accept the first candidate who ranks better than all of the first 37 candidates,' which could be misinterpreted as only comparing to the observation window. The Negative correctly clarifies that we must select the first candidate who is better than ALL previously seen candidates (not just the first 37), which is the accurate description of the optimal strategy. Both agree on the probability of approximately 37.1% (or 1/e), and both correctly identify r = 37 as optimal for n = 100.
