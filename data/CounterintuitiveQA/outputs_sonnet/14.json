    "debate_answer": "90 chairs are flipped back to their initial position. The reasoning is that a chair numbered n is flipped once for each of its divisors.

All other 90 chairs have an even number of divisors, are flipped an even number of times, and return to their initial position.",
    "Reason": "Both debaters actually arrived at the same correct answer of 90 chairs, but the Affirmative side presented a clearer and more direct logical path. The Affirmative correctly identified that: (1) chairs are flipped once for each divisor they have, (2) perfect squares have an odd number of divisors while other numbers have an even number, (3) chairs flipped an even number of times return to their initial position, and (4) therefore 100 - 10 = 90 chairs return to initial position.
