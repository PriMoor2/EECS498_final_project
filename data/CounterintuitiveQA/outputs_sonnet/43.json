    "debate_topic": "A Lady (L) bought an item of Rs 100 from the Shopkeeper (C). She paid him through a 500 Rs Note. Realizing that he did not have change, the shopkeeper C got change for that note from another shopkeeper (S) and paid Rs 400 to the Lady. After a few days, S realized that the note is fake, And this railed at C and took 500 Rs back from him. So in this whole process how much money did C lose in the end?",
    "base_answer": "Let me track the shopkeeper C's losses step by step:\n\n**Initial transaction:**\n1. Lady L gives C a fake 500 Rs note\n2. C goes to S and gets 500 Rs in change (giving the fake note)\n3. C gives L: 400 Rs change + 100 Rs item (worth 100 Rs)\n4. C keeps: 0 Rs\n\n**After S discovers the fake note:**\n5. C has to pay S back 500 Rs (to compensate for the fake note)\n\n**Total loss for C:**\n- Gave to L: 400 Rs (change) + 100 Rs (item value) = 500 Rs\n- Gave to S: 500 Rs (to make good the fake note)\n- Received: 0 Rs (the 500 Rs note was fake)\n\n**Total loss = 500 Rs + 500 Rs = 1000 Rs**\n\nWait, let me reconsider this more carefully:\n\n**What C lost:**\n- The item (worth 100 Rs)\n- Cash given to L as change (400 Rs)\n- Cash paid back to S (500 Rs)\n\n**What C gained:**\n- Nothing (the 500 Rs note was fake)\n\nBut the 500 Rs paid to S was actually the same 500 Rs C got from S initially, so:\n\n**Net loss = 400 Rs (change) + 100 Rs (item) = 500 Rs**\n\nThe answer is **500 Rs**. \n\nC lost exactly what he gave to the lady: 400 Rs in change plus a 100 Rs item.",
    "debate_answer": "The shopkeeper C lost Rs 500 in total. This consists of the 100 Rs item and 400 Rs cash given to Lady L in exchange for a fake note that has no value. The transaction with shopkeeper S (giving fake note, receiving 500 Rs, then returning 500 Rs) nets to zero and does not contribute to C's loss.",
    "Reason": "The Affirmative side presents a clear and correct analysis. The key insight is that the transaction with shopkeeper S nets to zero - C received 500 Rs from S and later returned 500 Rs to S, so there's no net loss from that exchange. The actual loss comes entirely from what C gave to Lady L: a 100 Rs item plus 400 Rs in cash, totaling 500 Rs, in exchange for a worthless fake note. The Negative side initially attempted to argue for 600 Rs but became confused in their reasoning and ultimately conceded that the Affirmative's analysis appears correct. The Negative side's self-correction and request for clarification indicates they recognize the flaw in their initial position. The correct answer is that C lost Rs 500 total.",
