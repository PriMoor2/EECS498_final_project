    "debate_answer": "ONE time - you can only subtract 10 from 100 once, because after that subtraction, you no longer have 100 to subtract from.",
    "Reason": "After careful consideration of both arguments, I find the affirmative side's interpretation more linguistically precise. The question specifically asks 'how many times can you subtract 10 FROM 100' - the key phrase being 'from 100.' The affirmative correctly identifies that after the first subtraction (100-10=90), you are no longer subtracting from 100, but from 90. This is a classic trick question that tests careful reading and literal interpretation. While the negative side's mathematical reasoning about repeated subtraction is valid for a differently worded question (such as 'how many times can you subtract 10, starting with 100'), it doesn't address the specific wording used here. The phrase 'from 100' anchors the subtraction to that specific number, not to a changing value. The affirmative's interpretation respects the precise language of the question, whereas the negative side assumes a different question than what was actually asked.",
