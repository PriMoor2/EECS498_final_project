    "Reason": "Both debaters ultimately agree on the same answer of 13/27, but the Affirmative side presented a clear, systematic, and correct analysis from the start. The Affirmative correctly identified this as a variant of the Boy or Girl paradox, properly set up the sample space with 196 total outcomes (14×14), accurately counted 27 outcomes where at least one boy was born on Tuesday, and correctly identified 13 outcomes where both children are boys given the constraint. The Negative side initially suggested there might be an error but then verified the Affirmative's work and conceded that the analysis was correct. Since both sides agree on 13/27 as the answer, and the Affirmative provided the clearer initial reasoning, the Affirmative side is supported.",
