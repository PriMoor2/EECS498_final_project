    "debate_topic": "Suppose we find a murderer's fingerprint at a crime scene. After comparing this fingerprint with 20000 people, the police found a suspect whose fingerprint matches the one at the scene. Now, this suspect is brought to court and accused of being the murderer. The expert in court tells you that the chance of modern fingerprint comparison technology mistaking two people's fingerprints as the same is 0.01%. Assuming that all 20000 people compared by the police are innocent, what is the percentage that at least one match will be produced after the murderer's fingerprint is compared with them one by one?",
