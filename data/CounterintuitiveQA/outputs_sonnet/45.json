The bridge can support only two people at a time. All the people don’t take the same time to cross the bridge. Time for each person: 1 min, 2 mins, 7 mins, and 10 mins. What is the shortest time needed for all four of them to cross the bridge?",
    "base_answer": "I need to find the shortest time for all four people to cross the bridge.\n\nLet me denote the people as A(1 min), B(2 mins), C(7 mins), and D(10 mins).\n\n**Key constraints:**\n- Maximum 2 people can cross at a time\n- They need the torch to cross\n- When two people cross together, they move at the speed of the slower person\n- Someone must bring the torch back for others to cross\n\n**Strategy considerations:**\n\nThere are two main approaches:\n\n**Approach 1: Use the fastest person (A) as the shuttle**\n- A and B cross (2 mins) → Total: 2\n- A returns (1 min) → Total: 3\n- A and C cross (7 mins) → Total: 10\n- A returns (1 min) → Total: 11\n- A and D cross (10 mins) → Total: 21\n\n**Approach 2: Send the two slowest together**\n- A and B cross (2 mins) → Total: 2\n- A returns (1 min) → Total: 3\n- C and D cross (10 mins) → Total: 13\n- B returns (2 mins) → Total: 15\n- A and B cross (2 mins) → Total: 17\n\nLet me verify Approach 2:\n1. A(1) and B(2) cross → 2 mins [C, D on left | A, B on right]\n2. A(1) returns → 1 min [A, C, D on left | B on right]\n3. C(7) and D(10) cross → 10 mins [A on left | B, C, D on right]\n4. B(2) returns → 2 mins [A, B on left | C, D on right]\n5. A(1) and B(2) cross → 2 mins [nobody on left | A, B, C, D on right]\n\nTotal: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = **17 minutes**\n\nThis is optimal because we minimize the \"cost\" of return trips and have the two slowest people cross together (so we only \"pay\" for the slowest person's time once).\n\nThe answer is **17 minutes**.",
    "debate_answer": "17 minutes",
    "Reason": "Both debaters actually arrived at the same conclusion that 17 minutes is the optimal solution. The Affirmative side presented a clear, well-structured argument from the start with the correct strategy: having the two fastest people (A and B) cross first, sending A back, then having the two slowest people (C and D) cross together, sending B back, and finally having A and B cross again. The Negative side initially claimed 19 minutes but then worked through alternative strategies and ultimately conceded that 17 minutes is correct. The strategy is mathematically sound: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes. This approach minimizes total time by ensuring the two slowest people cross together (avoiding having the 10-minute person cross the bridge twice) while using the fastest people as efficient shuttles for the torch. The Affirmative side demonstrated stronger initial analysis and confidence in their correct answer.",
