    "base_answer": "Looking at this step-by-step:\n\n**Given information:**\n- 5 machines produce 5 items in 5 minutes\n\n**Find the rate per machine:**\n- If 5 machines produce 5 items in 5 minutes, then each machine produces 1 item in 5 minutes\n\n**Apply to the new scenario:**\n- If each machine produces 1 item in 5 minutes\n- Then 100 machines produce 100 items in... **5 minutes**\n\nEach of the 100 machines produces 1 item in 5 minutes, giving you 100 items total in 5 minutes.",
    "debate_answer": "5 minutes",
    "Reason": "Both debaters have reached the same conclusion that the answer is 5 minutes. The Affirmative side presented a clear, logical breakdown of the problem: if 5 machines produce 5 items in 5 minutes, then each machine produces 1 item in 5 minutes. When scaled to 100 machines producing 100 items, the time remains constant at 5 minutes because the machines work in parallel. The Negative side, after careful analysis, acknowledged the correctness of this reasoning and agreed with the Affirmative's position. Since both sides concur on the answer and the mathematical logic is sound, there is clear consensus. The key insight is understanding that this is a parallel processing problem where production rate per machine remains constant, and proportional scaling of both machines and items does not change the time required.",
