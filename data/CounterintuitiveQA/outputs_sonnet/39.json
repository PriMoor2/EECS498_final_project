    "Reason": "Both the affirmative and negative sides have presented the same correct answer of 10 rats. The affirmative side provided a clear and accurate explanation using binary representation, showing that 2^10 = 1024 ≥ 1000, which is sufficient to distinguish between 1000 bottles. The negative side explicitly agreed with this answer and provided additional confirmation of why this is correct, including mathematical proof that 9 rats would be insufficient (2^9 = 512 < 1000) and verification through an example. Both sides correctly identified that this is an information theory problem where each rat represents one bit of information, and the death pattern of rats encodes the binary representation of the poisoned bottle's number.
