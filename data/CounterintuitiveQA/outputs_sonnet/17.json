    "Reason": "Both debaters actually agree on the answer of 36 days and the mathematical methodology. The Affirmative side presented a complete, well-structured solution with clear step-by-step calculations, proper use of logarithms to solve the inequality, and verification of the answer at both n=35 and n=36. The Negative side acknowledged complete agreement with the Affirmative's answer and approach, confirming the correctness of the solution. Since both sides converge on the same answer with the same reasoning, and the Affirmative side presented the solution first with comprehensive detail, I support the Affirmative side's presentation. The answer is definitively 36 days, as this is the minimum number of days needed to achieve a greater than 50% probability of drawing the Ace of Spades at least once.",
