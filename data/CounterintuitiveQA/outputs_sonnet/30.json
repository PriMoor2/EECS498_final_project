    "debate_topic": "A group of police officers have breathalyzers displaying false drunkenness in 5% of the cases in which the driver is sober. However, the breathalyzers never fail to detect a truly drunk person. One in a thousand drivers is driving drunk. Suppose the police officers then stop a driver at random, and force the driver to take a breathalyzer test. It indicates that the driver is drunk. We assume you don't know anything else about him or her. How high is the probability he or she really is drunk?",
    "base_answer": "I need to find the probability that the driver is actually drunk given that the breathalyzer test is positive.\n\nLet me define the events:\n- D = driver is drunk\n- + = breathalyzer indicates drunk (positive test)\n\n**Given information:**\n- P(+|sober) = 0.05 (false positive rate)\n- P(+|D) = 1 (the test never fails to detect a truly drunk person)\n- P(D) = 0.001 (one in a thousand drivers is drunk)\n- P(sober) = 0.999\n\n**I need to find: P(D|+)**\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(D|+) = P(+|D) × P(D) / P(+)\n\nFirst, I need to find P(+) using the law of total probability:\n\nP(+) = P(+|D) × P(D) + P(+|sober) × P(sober)\n\nP(+) = 1 × 0.001 + 0.05 × 0.999\n\nP(+) = 0.001 + 0.04995\n\nP(+) = 0.05095\n\nNow I can calculate P(D|+):\n\nP(D|+) = (1 × 0.001) / 0.05095\n\nP(D|+) = 0.001 / 0.05095\n\nP(D|+) ≈ 0.0196 or about **1.96%**\n\n**Answer: Approximately 2% (or more precisely, about 1 in 51)**\n\nThis surprisingly low probability occurs because drunk drivers are so rare (0.1%) compared to the false positive rate (5%). Even though the test is quite accurate, when you test a random driver, you're much more likely to encounter a sober driver who gets a false positive than an actually drunk driver.",
    "debate_answer": "The probability that the driver is actually drunk given a positive breathalyzer test is approximately 1.96% or about 2%. This is calculated using Bayes' Theorem: P(drunk|positive) = P(positive|drunk) × P(drunk) / P(positive) = (1.0 × 0.001) / (0.001 + 0.05 × 0.999) = 0.001 / 0.05095 ≈ 0.0196 or 1.96%. Out of approximately 51 positive tests (1 true positive and 50 false positives per 1000 drivers), only 1 represents an actually drunk driver.",
    "Reason": "Both debaters have actually reached the same conclusion and agree on the answer of approximately 1.96% (or about 2%). The Affirmative side presented a clear, methodical solution using Bayes' Theorem with correct calculations. The Negative side verified this calculation, provided an alternative natural frequencies approach that confirms the same answer, and explicitly conceded that the Affirmative's answer is correct. Since both sides agree on the mathematical solution and the Affirmative presented it first with proper methodology, I support the Affirmative side. The key insight both sides correctly identified is that despite a positive breathalyzer test, the extremely low base rate (0.1% drunk drivers) combined with the 5% false positive rate means that false positives vastly outnumber true positives, resulting in only about a 2% probability that a driver who tests positive is actually drunk.",
