    "base_answer": "I need to find the ages of Alok's three daughters.\n\n**Step 1: Find all possible combinations of three ages that multiply to 72.**\n\nLet me list all combinations of three positive integers (a, b, c) where a × b × c = 72:\n\n- (1, 1, 72) → sum = 74\n- (1, 2, 36) → sum = 39\n- (1, 3, 24) → sum = 28\n- (1, 4, 18) → sum = 23\n- (1, 6, 12) → sum = 19\n- (1, 8, 9) → sum = 18\n- (2, 2, 18) → sum = 22\n- (2, 3, 12) → sum = 17\n- (2, 4, 9) → sum = 15\n- (2, 6, 6) → sum = 14\n- (3, 3, 8) → sum = 14\n- (3, 4, 6) → sum = 13\n\n**Step 2: Analyze why the house number wasn't enough information.**\n\nAfter Shyam saw the house number (which equals the sum of ages), he still couldn't determine the ages.

    "Reason": "Both the affirmative and negative sides have presented identical conclusions with sound mathematical reasoning. The affirmative side systematically worked through the problem: (1) identified all factorizations of 72, (2) recognized that sum 14 is the only duplicate sum appearing in combinations [2,6,6] and [3,3,8], (3) correctly interpreted 'the oldest girl' as singular, eliminating [2,6,6] which has twin oldest daughters. The negative side verified each step and confirmed complete agreement.
