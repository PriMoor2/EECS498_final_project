    "Reason": "Both debaters actually arrived at the same answer of 55 mice, which demonstrates agreement rather than disagreement. The Affirmative side presented a clear, systematic month-by-month breakdown that correctly tracks: (1) the original mouse producing litters at months 2, 3, and 4; (2) the first generation born in month 2 reaching reproductive age and producing offspring in month 4; and (3) properly accounting for mice that haven't yet reached reproductive age. The Negative side acknowledged this calculation was correct and even replicated it, arriving at the same 55 mice. The Negative's attempt to find disagreement by questioning interpretation of 'after 4 months' or timing nuances doesn't identify any actual error in the Affirmative's logic. The calculation is mathematically sound: 1 original mouse + 6 (month 2) + 6 (month 3) + 6 (month 4 from original) + 36 (month 4 from first generation) = 55 mice total.",
