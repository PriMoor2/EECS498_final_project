The negative side explicitly agrees with all aspects of the affirmative's solution, including the problem understanding, mathematical approach, calculation method, final answer of 25,000 miles, and verification. Both sides correctly identified that: (1) Total tyre-miles available = 5 × 20,000 = 100,000 miles, (2) Since 4 tyres are always in use, 4D = 100,000, therefore D = 25,000 miles, (3) Each tyre should be used for 4/5 of the journey to achieve even wear distribution.
