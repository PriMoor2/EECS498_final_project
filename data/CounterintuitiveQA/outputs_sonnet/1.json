    "Reason": "Both the affirmative and negative sides have presented identical analyses and arrived at the same answer of 3/4 or 0.75. The negative side explicitly agrees with the affirmative's reasoning and independently verifies the calculation using Bayes' theorem. Both correctly identify the two scenarios (Alice went out vs. stayed home), properly calculate the conditional probabilities, and apply Bayes' theorem to arrive at P(at bar 3 | not at bars 1,2) = 0.3/0.4 = 0.75.
