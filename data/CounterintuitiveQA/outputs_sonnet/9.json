    "Reason": "This is an unusual situation where both debaters actually agree on the answer. The Affirmative side presented a correct analysis using Bayes' Theorem and arrived at 41.4% as the probability that the taxi is actually blue. The Negative side, despite being positioned as the opposing side, explicitly agreed with this analysis and confirmed that 41.4% is the correct answer. Both sides correctly identified that this is a classic example of the base rate fallacy, where the low prior probability of blue taxis (15%) combined with the witness's 80% accuracy rate results in a counterintuitive answer. The mathematical calculation is sound: P(Blue|Witness says Blue) = (0.15 × 0.80) / [(0.15 × 0.80) + (0.85 × 0.20)] = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.414 or 41.4%.
