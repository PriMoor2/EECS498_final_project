    "Reason": "The Affirmative side presented a clear, mathematically sound argument that 23 people are needed to exceed 50% probability of a shared birthday. The Negative side initially attempted to challenge this but ultimately conceded that the Affirmative's answer of 23 is correct under standard assumptions. While the Negative side raised valid points about real-world considerations (leap years, non-uniform distributions), they acknowledged these are departures from the standard problem formulation. The classic Birthday Paradox problem, as traditionally stated, assumes 365 days and uniform distribution, making 23 the definitively correct answer. The Negative side's concession and verification of the Affirmative's calculations confirms this. Both debaters showed good mathematical understanding, but the Affirmative maintained the correct position throughout while the Negative ultimately agreed with them.",
