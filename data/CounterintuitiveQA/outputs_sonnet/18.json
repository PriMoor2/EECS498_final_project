    "base_answer": "I need to figure out how many more birds will be on the right side than the left side after one bird moves.\n\n**Starting position:**\n- Left side: 25 birds\n- Right side: 25 birds\n\n**After one bird moves from left to right:**\n- Left side: 25 - 1 = 24 birds\n- Right side: 25 + 1 = 26 birds\n\n**Difference:**\n26 - 24 = 2 birds\n\nThere will be **2 more birds** on the right side than the left side.",
    "debate_answer": "2 birds",
    "Reason": "Both the affirmative and negative sides have arrived at the exact same answer of 2 birds. The negative side initially suggested disagreement but then acknowledged that their calculation matched the affirmative side's calculation perfectly. Both sides correctly calculated that after one bird moves from the left side (reducing it to 24) to the right side (increasing it to 26), the difference is 26 - 24 = 2 birds. Since both debaters agree on the methodology, the arithmetic, and the final answer, there is no substantive disagreement to adjudicate. The answer is clearly and unanimously established as 2 birds.",
