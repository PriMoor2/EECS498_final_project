    "Reason": "The Negative side presents a more rigorous interpretation of the problem. While the Affirmative side's borrowing strategy is creative, it introduces assumptions not stated in the original problem. The problem clearly states 'you can use 3 peach pits to exchange for one peach' - there is no mention of borrowing mechanisms. The Negative side correctly points out that: (1) The borrowing strategy violates the problem's constraints by assuming mechanisms not described; (2) It creates logical inconsistencies - if borrowing were allowed, the problem would lack a definite answer; (3) The causal relationship is violated - you cannot have a pit from a peach before eating it; (4) This is a standard mathematical problem testing exchange rate understanding, not creative loopholes. The straightforward calculation is: 10 initial peaches + 3 peaches (from 9 pits) + 1 peach (from 3 pits) = 14 peaches, with 2 pits remaining that cannot be exchanged.",
