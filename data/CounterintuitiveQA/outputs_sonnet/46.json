    "base_answer": "I need to track the man's progress day by day, keeping in mind that once he reaches the top, he won't slip back.\n\nLet me trace through this:\n\n**Each complete day cycle:** He climbs 4m up, then slips 3m down = net progress of 1m per day\n\n**But here's the key:** On the day he reaches the top during his climb, he gets out and doesn't slip back.\n\nLet me track his position at the end of each day (after slipping):\n- End of Day 1: 4 - 3 = 1m\n- End of Day 2: 1 + 4 - 3 = 2m\n- End of Day 3: 2 + 4 - 3 = 3m\n- ...and so on\n\nAfter n complete days (with slipping), he's at: n meters\n\n**The critical point:** He needs to reach 50m during his climb (before slipping).\n\n- After 46 complete days: he's at 46m\n- On Day 47: he starts at 46m, climbs 4m, reaching 50m ✓\n\nHe escapes during the climb on Day 47, before he would slip.\n\n**Answer: 47 days**",
    "debate_answer": "47 days",
    "Reason": "The Affirmative side presented a clear and correct analysis from the start. They correctly identified that the man makes a net progress of 1 meter per complete day-night cycle, but crucially recognized that on the final day, once he reaches 50 meters during his climb, he escapes immediately without slipping back. Their calculation shows: after 46 complete cycles, the man is at 46 meters; on day 47, he climbs 4 meters to reach 50 meters and exits the well. The Negative side initially challenged this but then recalculated and acknowledged that the Affirmative's answer of 47 days is correct. Both debaters ultimately agreed on the same answer through logical reasoning, with the Affirmative side demonstrating the correct approach from the beginning.",
