    "Reason": "Both debaters arrived at the same answer of 48% milk remaining in the cup. The affirmative side presented a clear, step-by-step solution that correctly tracked the milk concentration through each operation. The negative side initially suggested there might be an error but then verified the calculation and confirmed the same result. Both used correct mathematical reasoning: starting with 100% milk, after drinking 20% and refilling with water, the concentration becomes 80% milk. Then drinking 40% of this mixture removes 40% of the milk (leaving 48% of the original volume as milk), and refilling with water maintains this 48% milk concentration in the full cup. Since both sides agree on the methodology and the final answer, there is no disagreement to adjudicate.",
