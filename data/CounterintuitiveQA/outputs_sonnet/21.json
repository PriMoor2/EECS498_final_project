    "debate_topic": "A vendor is pulling a cart full of watermelons weighing 100 kilograms. He needs to cross a desert to the other side to sell them. Due to the hot and dry climate of the desert, the water content of the watermelons decreases from 99% to 98%. What is the current weight of the watermelons?",
    "base_answer": "I need to find the weight of the watermelons after their water content decreases from 99% to 98%.\n\n**Initial situation:**\n- Total weight: 100 kg\n- Water content: 99%\n- This means: Water = 99 kg, Non-water (solid matter) = 1 kg\n\n**Key insight:** The solid matter doesn't change, only the water evaporates.\n\n**After crossing the desert:**\n- Non-water (solid matter) = 1 kg (unchanged)\n- Water content: 98%\n- This means the solid matter now represents 2% of the total weight\n\n**Setting up the equation:**\nIf solid matter = 2% of total weight, then:\n- 1 kg = 2% × (new total weight)\n- 1 kg = 0.02 × (new total weight)\n- New total weight = 1 ÷ 0.02 = 50 kg\n\n**Verification:**\n- New weight: 50 kg\n- Water: 98% × 50 = 49 kg\n- Solid matter: 2% × 50 = 1 kg ✓\n\nThe current weight of the watermelons is **50 kilograms**.\n\nThis surprising result shows that even a small change in water percentage (from 99% to 98%) can result in a large change in total weight when the water content is very high.",
    "debate_answer": "50 kilograms",
    "Reason": "The affirmative side's interpretation is correct. When we say 'water content decreases from 99% to 98%', this refers to the percentage composition of the watermelons, not a 1% loss of the water mass. The key insight is that the solid matter (non-water content) remains constant at 1 kg throughout. Initially, this 1 kg represents 1% of the total 100 kg. After water evaporation, this same 1 kg of solid matter now represents 2% of the new total weight. Using the equation: 1 kg = 0.02 × (new weight), we get new weight = 50 kg. The negative side's error is in misinterpreting 'water content decreases from 99% to 98%' as losing 1% of the water mass, rather than understanding it as a change in the percentage composition. The affirmative's answer of 50 kg, while counterintuitive, is mathematically correct. This is a classic problem that demonstrates how small changes in percentage composition can lead to dramatic changes in total weight when dealing with very high percentages.",
