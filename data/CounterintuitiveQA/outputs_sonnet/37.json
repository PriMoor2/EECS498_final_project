    "base_answer": "I need to find the total distance traveled by the bee flying back and forth between two trains approaching each other.\n\n**Given Information:**\n- Speed of Train 1: 50 km/h\n- Speed of Train 2: 70 km/h\n- Initial distance between trains: 100 km\n- Speed of bee: 80 km/h\n\n**Key Insight:**\nInstead of calculating each individual trip of the bee, I can use the fact that the bee flies continuously until the trains collide.

    "Reason": "Both debaters actually agree on the solution and answer. The Affirmative side presented a clear, elegant solution using the key insight that the bee flies continuously until the trains collide. The calculation is correct: relative speed of trains = 120 km/h, time to collision = 100/120 = 5/6 hours, and bee's distance = 80 × 5/6 = 200/3 ≈ 66.67 km. The Negative side acknowledged this solution is completely correct and could not provide any valid disagreement. Since the Affirmative side presented the solution first with proper methodology and the Negative side concurred, the preference goes to the Affirmative side for their initial correct analysis.",
