    "debate_answer": "Second position. When you overtake the second person in a race, you move into second place. The first-place person is still ahead of you, and the person you overtook drops to third place. This is a classic logic puzzle designed to test whether people mistakenly assume that overtaking second place makes them first.",
    "Reason": "Both debaters actually agree on the correct answer: you are in second position after overtaking the second person. The Affirmative side presented a clear, logical argument explaining why overtaking the second-place person puts you in second place. The Negative side acknowledged this answer is correct and even admitted they cannot genuinely disagree with a correct answer. Since both sides agree on the same conclusion and the Affirmative side presented the argument first with sound reasoning, I support the Affirmative side. The logic is straightforward: if you overtake the person in second place, you take their position (second), while the first-place person remains ahead of you.",
