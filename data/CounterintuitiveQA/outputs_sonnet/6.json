    "Reason": "Both debaters have now reached complete agreement that the answer is 13, and both have provided sound reasoning. The affirmative side presented a clear, structured proof: (1) To maximize count, use smallest numbers; (2) Sum of 1-13 is 91, sum of 1-14 is 105; (3) Since 91 < 100 < 105, we can achieve exactly 100 with 13 numbers by removing 5 from the set {1,2,3,...,14}; (4) It's impossible to have 14 distinct natural numbers sum to 100 because the minimum sum of any 14 distinct natural numbers is 105, which exceeds 100. The negative side confirmed this reasoning and attempted to find counterexamples using non-consecutive numbers, but correctly concluded that all such attempts fail because you cannot select 14 distinct natural numbers with a sum less than 105. Both sides have thoroughly verified that 13 is the maximum, making this the definitive answer.",

Let me present my analysis.\\n\\nYou correctly identified that the sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n+1)/2, and found that:\\n- Sum of 1 to 13 = 91\\n- Sum of 1 to 14 = 105\\n\\nHowever, your conclusion that we can only use 13 distinct numbers is incorrect.\\n\\nHere's the key insight: When we have 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 13 = 91, we need 9 more to reach 100. Instead of adding a new number or replacing one, we should REMOVE a number from our sequence.\\n\\nIf we remove the number 4 from the sequence {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}, we get:\\n1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 = 91 - 4 = 87\\n\\nThis is still not 100. Let me reconsider.\\n\\nActually, let's use 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 14 = 105, which is 5 more than 100.\\n\\nIf we remove 5 from this sequence, we get:\\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 = 105 - 5 = 100 ✓\\n\\nThis gives us 14 - 1 = **13 distinct natural numbers**.\\n\\nWait, this confirms your answer of 13. Let me reconsider if 14 is possible.\\n\\nFor 14 distinct numbers: We'd need their sum to equal 100, with minimum sum being 1+2+...+14 = 105. We cannot achieve exactly 100 with 14 consecutive starting numbers without removing one.\\n\\nBut what if we don't use consecutive numbers? We could use: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 (skipping 14).\\nSum = 91 + 15 = 106, still too much.\\n\\nActually, upon reflection, your answer of **13** appears correct.\",\n  \"answer\": 13\n}\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' answers and determine if there is a clear preference for an answer candidate.

The affirmative side's approach of using 1-12 plus 22 is valid and gives 13 numbers. The negative side confirmed this by showing that using 1-14 (excluding 5) also gives 13 numbers summing to 100. However, neither side has rigorously proven that 14 is impossible. They need to explore whether using non-consecutive numbers starting from 1 could yield 14 distinct numbers summing to 100. For example, could we use 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,x where x is chosen to make the sum exactly 100? Or could we skip a smaller number and include more numbers? The minimum sum of 14 distinct natural numbers is 1+2+...+14=105, which is 5 more than needed. To get 14 numbers summing to 100, we'd need to replace one number with a smaller value, but all numbers 1-14 are already the smallest possible distinct natural numbers.
