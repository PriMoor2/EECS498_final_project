    "debate_answer": "1.5 m/s",
    "Reason": "Both debaters actually agree on the answer of 1.5 m/s. The affirmative side presented a mathematically rigorous argument using the correct formula for average speed (total distance / total time). They properly identified that this is a harmonic mean problem, not an arithmetic mean problem. The calculation is correct: assuming distance d for each direction, time uphill is d/1 = d seconds, time downhill is d/3 seconds, total time is 4d/3 seconds, and average speed is 2d/(4d/3) = 1.5 m/s. The negative side, after analysis, concurred with this reasoning and confirmed the correctness of the affirmative's answer. Since both sides agree and the mathematical reasoning is sound, the affirmative side's original position is correct.",
