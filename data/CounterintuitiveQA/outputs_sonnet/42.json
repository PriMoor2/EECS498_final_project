    "base_answer": "I need to figure out the maximum number of chocolates I can eat with 15 Rs, considering I can exchange 3 wrappers for 1 new chocolate.\n\n**Step 1: Initial purchase**\n- With 15 Rs, I can buy 15 chocolates\n- After eating them, I have 15 wrappers\n\n**Step 2: First exchange**\n- 15 wrappers ÷ 3 = 5 new chocolates\n- After eating these 5, I have 5 wrappers\n\n**Step 3: Second exchange**\n- 5 wrappers ÷ 3 = 1 new chocolate (with 2 wrappers remaining)\n- After eating this 1 chocolate, I have 2 + 1 = 3 wrappers\n\n**Step 4: Third exchange**\n- 3 wrappers ÷ 3 = 1 new chocolate\n- After eating this, I have 1 wrapper left (can't exchange anymore)\n\n**Total chocolates eaten:**\n15 + 5 + 1 + 1 = **22 chocolates**",
    "debate_answer": "22",
    "Reason": "The affirmative side's answer of 22 chocolates is correct based on standard mathematical logic and the problem constraints. The negative side's proposal of 23 chocolates relies on a 'borrowing' strategy that is not supported by the problem statement. The shopkeeper's offer is clear: you can exchange 3 wrappers for 1 chocolate. There is no mention of borrowing wrappers or credit systems. The negative side's borrowing mechanism creates an artificial loophole that violates the basic exchange rule. When you have only 1 wrapper remaining, you cannot make another exchange because you don't have the required 3 wrappers. The borrowing strategy assumes the shopkeeper would accept a future wrapper as payment, which is speculation beyond the problem's scope. The affirmative side correctly follows the exchange rules without adding assumptions, arriving at the mathematically sound answer of 22 chocolates (15 initial + 5 from first exchange + 1 from second exchange + 1 from third exchange).",
