    "base_answer": "I need to find the expected ratio of boys to girls when families keep having children until they get a boy, then stop.\n\n## Setting up the problem\n\nLet me assume:\n- Probability of boy = probability of girl = 0.5\n- Each family stops after having their first boy\n\n## Analyzing family compositions\n\nFamilies can have these patterns:\n- B (boy first): probability = 1/2\n- GB (girl, then boy): probability = 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4\n- GGB (two girls, then boy): probability = 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/8\n- GGGB (three girls, then boy): probability = 1/8 × 1/2 = 1/16\n- And so on...\n\n## Expected number of boys per family\n\nEvery family has exactly **1 boy** (since they stop after having a boy).\n\n## Expected number of girls per family\n\nThe expected number of girls is:\n- 0 girls with probability 1/2\n- 1 girl with probability 1/4\n- 2 girls with probability 1/8\n- 3 girls with probability 1/16\n- And so on...\n\nExpected girls = 0(1/2) + 1(1/4) + 2(1/8) + 3(1/16) + ...\n\nThis is the sum: Σ(n × (1/2)^(n+1)) for n = 0 to ∞\n\nUsing the formula for this series: Σ(n × r^n) = r/(1-r)² where r = 1/2\n\nExpected girls = (1/2) × Σ(n × (1/2)^n) = (1/2) × (1/2)/(1-1/2)² = (1/2) × (1/2)/(1/4) = 1\n\n## Result\n\n- Expected boys per family: **1**\n- Expected girls per family: **1**\n\n**The expected ratio of boys to girls is 1:1**\n\nThis makes intuitive sense: the stopping rule doesn't change the underlying probability. Each birth is still 50-50, and in the long run across all births in the country, half will be boys and half will be girls.",
    "debate_answer": "The expected ratio of boys to girls in the country is 1:1. Each family will have exactly one boy (by the stopping rule), and the expected number of girls per family is also 1, calculated as Σ(n=0 to ∞) n × (1/2)^(n+1) = 1. Therefore, across the entire population, the ratio remains 1:1 despite the biased stopping rule.",
    "Reason": "Both sides actually agree on the answer that the expected ratio is 1:1, which is mathematically correct. The Affirmative side presents a clear, structured argument with three key points: independence of events, expected value calculation, and mathematical proof. The Negative side, while providing valid verification from different angles, explicitly acknowledges agreement with the Affirmative position and even apologizes for the 'initial disagreement premise.' Since both sides converge on the same correct answer of 1:1, but the Affirmative side presented the argument first with clear mathematical reasoning (expected girls per family = Σ(n=0 to ∞) n × (1/2)^(n+1) = 1, and expected boys = 1), the Affirmative side should be supported. The key insight both sides correctly identify is that while every family has exactly 1 boy, the expected number of girls per family is also 1, making the population ratio 1:1. The stopping rule affects when families stop having children but does not change the fundamental 50-50 probability of each birth.",
