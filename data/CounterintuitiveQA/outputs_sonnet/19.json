    "debate_topic": "You borrowed a pen from your friend. This pen can write 500 words on average before running out of ink. After writing a 300-word letter to your friend, you want to know how much longer the pen can write. However, your friend told you that this pen writes twice as fast when the pen is warmer, which happened during the first 150 words. How many more words can you write with this pen?",
    "base_answer": "I need to figure out how much ink was actually used, accounting for the pen writing twice as fast when warm.\n\n**Understanding \"writes twice as fast when warmer\":**\nWhen a pen writes twice as fast, it uses ink twice as quickly, meaning each word consumes twice as much ink.\n\n**Ink consumption during the 300-word letter:**\n\n- First 150 words (pen was warmer): Uses ink at 2× the normal rate\n  - Ink consumed = 150 words × 2 = 300 words worth of ink\n\n- Remaining 150 words (normal temperature): Uses ink at normal rate\n  - Ink consumed = 150 words × 1 = 150 words worth of ink\n\n**Total ink consumed:**\n300 + 150 = 450 words worth of ink\n\n**Remaining ink capacity:**\n500 - 450 = 50 words worth of ink\n\n**Answer:** You can write **50 more words** with this pen (assuming normal temperature conditions).",
    "debate_answer": "200 words",
    "Reason": "Both debaters have now reached consensus that the answer is 200 words. The Negative side's interpretation has proven more convincing through the debate. The key reasoning is that 'writes twice as fast' refers to writing speed (words per unit time), not ink consumption rate. In standard pen mechanics, the amount of ink used per word is determined by the physical act of forming letters on paper, not by how quickly those letters are formed. The pen's 500-word capacity represents a fixed amount of ink that can produce 500 words regardless of writing speed. Temperature may affect ink viscosity and writing smoothness, making the pen write faster, but this doesn't change the ink volume required per word. Since 300 words were written, 300 words worth of ink was consumed, leaving 200 words of capacity remaining. The Affirmative side has also conceded to this interpretation after careful consideration, recognizing that the Negative's argument aligns better with real-world pen behavior and logical reasoning.",

In real-world physics, a warmer pen could potentially have lower ink viscosity leading to heavier flow, supporting the Affirmative's view.

The Negative side's interpretation has proven more convincing through the debate. The key reasoning is that 'writes twice as fast' refers to writing speed (words per unit time), not ink consumption rate. In standard pen mechanics, the amount of ink used per word is determined by the physical act of forming letters on paper, not by how quickly those letters are formed. The pen's 500-word capacity represents a fixed amount of ink that can produce 500 words regardless of writing speed. Temperature may affect ink viscosity and writing smoothness, making the pen write faster, but this doesn't change the ink volume required per word. Since 300 words were written, 300 words worth of ink was consumed, leaving 200 words of capacity remaining.
