    "base_answer": "I need to find the probability of seeing a vehicle in 10 minutes, given that the probability of seeing at least one vehicle in 30 minutes is 0.95.\n\nLet me assume vehicles appear according to a Poisson process (a reasonable model for random arrivals on a deserted road).\n\n**Setting up the problem:**\n\nLet λ = rate of vehicles per minute\n\nFor a Poisson process, the probability of seeing at least one vehicle in time t is:\nP(at least one in time t) = 1 - P(zero vehicles in time t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**Using the 30-minute information:**\n\nGiven: P(at least one vehicle in 30 min) = 0.95\n\nSo: 1 - e^(-30λ) = 0.95\n\nTherefore: e^(-30λ) = 0.05\n\nTaking natural log: -30λ = ln(0.05)\n\nλ = -ln(0.05)/30 = ln(20)/30\n\n**Finding the 10-minute probability:**\n\nP(at least one vehicle in 10 min) = 1 - e^(-10λ)\n\nSubstituting λ:\n= 1 - e^(-10 × ln(20)/30)\n= 1 - e^(-ln(20)/3)\n= 1 - e^(ln(20^(-1/3)))\n= 1 - 20^(-1/3)\n= 1 - 1/∛20\n= 1 - 1/2.714...\n≈ 1 - 0.368\n≈ **0.632 or about 63.2%**\n\nAlternatively, since e^(-30λ) = 0.05:\ne^(-10λ) = (e^(-30λ))^(1/3) = 0.05^(1/3) ≈ 0.368\n\nSo P(at least one in 10 min) = 1 - 0.368 ≈ **0.632 or 63.2%**",
    "debate_answer": "The probability of seeing a vehicle in 10 minutes is approximately 63.2% (or more precisely, 1 - ∛0.05 ≈ 0.632). This is derived by recognizing that P(no vehicle in 30 min) = 0.05, and since 30 minutes equals three 10-minute periods, P(no vehicle in 10 min) = ∛0.05 ≈ 0.368, making P(seeing a vehicle in 10 min) = 1 - 0.368 ≈ 0.632 or 63.2%.",
    "Reason": "The Affirmative side presented a clear, mathematically sound solution to the problem. They correctly identified that working with complement probabilities is the key approach, and properly applied the principle that for independent events, P(no vehicle in 30 min) = [P(no vehicle in 10 min)]³. Their calculation yielding approximately 63.2% is correct. The Negative side initially attempted to challenge this approach but ultimately conceded that the Affirmative's analysis was sound and mathematically consistent. The Negative side verified the internal consistency of the approach by checking with different time intervals (5 minutes) and confirmed the result. Both sides agreed on the reasonableness of assuming a memoryless (Poisson-like) process for vehicle arrivals on a deserted road. Since the Negative side conceded and agreed with the Affirmative's answer, there is a clear preference for the Affirmative side's solution.",
