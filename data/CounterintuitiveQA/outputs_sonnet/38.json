    "base_answer": "I need to find the distribution that maximizes the probability of picking a white ball.\n\nLet me denote:\n- Bowl 1: w₁ white balls, b₁ black balls\n- Bowl 2: w₂ white balls, b₂ black balls\n\nWhere w₁ + w₂ = 50 and b₁ + b₂ = 50\n\nThe probability of picking a white ball is:\nP(white) = P(Bowl 1) × P(white|Bowl 1) + P(Bowl 2) × P(white|Bowl 2)\nP(white) = (1/2) × [w₁/(w₁+b₁)] + (1/2) × [w₂/(w₂+b₂)]\n\nTo maximize this, I should consider an extreme distribution.\n\n**Optimal Strategy: Put 1 white ball in Bowl 1, and everything else in Bowl 2**\n\n- Bowl 1: 1 white, 0 black\n- Bowl 2: 49 white, 50 black\n\nLet me calculate this probability:\nP(white) = (1/2) × (1/1) + (1/2) × (49/99)\nP(white) = (1/2) × 1 + (1/2) × (49/99)\nP(white) = 1/2 + 49/198\nP(white) = 99/198 + 49/198 = 148/198 ≈ 74.7%\n\nLet me verify this is better than the uniform distribution:\n- Uniform: Both bowls have 25 white, 25 black\n- P(white) = (1/2) × (25/50) + (1/2) × (25/50) = 1/2 = 50%\n\nThe key insight is that by isolating one white ball alone in a bowl, I guarantee a 50% chance of picking white from that bowl (if it's selected), while still maintaining a reasonable chance (49/99 ≈ 49.5%) from the other bowl.\n\n**Answer: Place 1 white ball in one bowl, and all remaining balls (49 white, 50 black) in the other bowl.**\n\nThis gives approximately a 74.7% chance of selecting a white ball.",
    "debate_answer": "Bowl 1: 1 white ball; Bowl 2: 49 white balls and 50 black balls. This distribution maximizes the probability of selecting a white ball at approximately 74.75%.",
    "Reason": "Both debaters actually agree on the solution, which is a strong indicator that the answer is correct. The Affirmative side presented the optimal distribution strategy first: placing 1 white ball in Bowl 1 and 49 white balls with 50 black balls in Bowl 2, achieving a probability of approximately 74.75%. The Negative side confirmed this answer by verifying it against alternative distributions and explaining why this configuration is mathematically optimal. The key insight is that isolating a single white ball in one bowl guarantees a 100% success rate when that bowl is selected (50% of the time), while maintaining the best possible ratio in the second bowl (49/99). This exploits the asymmetry of the problem better than any symmetric distribution. Since both sides agree and the mathematical reasoning is sound, the Affirmative side should be credited for presenting the correct answer first.",
