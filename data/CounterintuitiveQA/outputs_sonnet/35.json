    "Reason": "Both debaters arrived at the same numerical answer of 4 revolutions, but the Negative side provided the more accurate reasoning. The Affirmative side made an error in their analysis by suggesting there should be an additional revolution added (4 from rolling + 1 from orbiting = 5), but then contradicted themselves by using the correct formula (R+r)/r = 4. The Negative side correctly identified this conceptual error and explained that the formula (R+r)/r already accounts for ALL rotation - both the rolling motion and the rotation due to following the curved path. There is no separate additional revolution to add. The path length of the center of Circle A (8πr) divided by Circle A's circumference (2πr) gives exactly 4 revolutions, which is the complete and correct answer. The Negative side's explanation is clearer, more consistent, and addresses the common misconception about the 'coin rotation paradox' effectively.",
