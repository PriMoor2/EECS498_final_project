    "debate_answer": "512",
    "Reason": "The affirmative side's interpretation is correct. The problem states 'On the first day, you add one fish to the tank. Every day thereafter, each fish in the tank births one new fish.' The key phrase 'every day thereafter' clearly indicates that birthing begins on Day 2, not Day 1. The affirmative correctly interprets this: Day 1 has 1 fish (the one we added), and starting from Day 2, each existing fish births one new fish, causing the population to double daily. The formula 2^(n-1) correctly captures this pattern. The negative side's interpretation that births occur 'at the end of Day 1' contradicts the plain meaning of 'thereafter' (meaning 'after that' or 'from then on'). If births occurred on Day 1, the problem would say 'every day' not 'every day thereafter.' The affirmative's step-by-step calculation is accurate and properly accounts for the timing specified in the problem.",
