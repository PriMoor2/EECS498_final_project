    "debate_answer": "45 minutes",
    "Reason": "Both debaters have arrived at the same answer of 45 minutes through essentially identical logical reasoning. The affirmative side presented a clear, systematic approach: Sita saved 30 minutes total, which means 15 minutes each way, so she met Ram at 5:45 PM (15 minutes before her usual 6 PM arrival at the station). Since Ram started walking at 5 PM, he walked for 45 minutes. The negative side initially suggested there might be an error but upon careful analysis reached the exact same conclusion using the same logic. Both correctly identified that the 30-minute time savings represents the round trip distance Sita didn't have to drive (from meeting point to station and back), which is 15 minutes one way. Both correctly calculated that Ram walked from 5 PM to 5:45 PM, totaling 45 minutes. The negative side even acknowledged that their reasoning aligned with the affirmative side. Since both debaters agree on the methodology, logic, and final answer, there is no substantive disagreement to adjudicate.",
