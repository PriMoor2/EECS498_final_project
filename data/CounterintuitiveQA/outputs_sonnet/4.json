    "debate_topic": "We put 10 g salt into 100 g water. What is the percentage of salt now?",
    "base_answer": "To find the percentage of salt in the solution, I need to calculate:\n\n**Percentage = (mass of salt / total mass of solution) × 100%**\n\nGiven:\n- Mass of salt = 10 g\n- Mass of water = 100 g\n- Total mass of solution = 10 g + 100 g = 110 g\n\n**Percentage of salt = (10 g / 110 g) × 100% = 9.09%**\n\nThe percentage of salt in the solution is approximately **9.09%** (or 9.1%).",
    "debate_answer": "The percentage of salt in the solution is 9.09% (or approximately 9.1% when rounded to one decimal place). This is calculated as: (10 g salt / 110 g total solution) × 100 = 9.09%",
    "Reason": "Both debaters have presented identical calculations and reached the same correct conclusion. The affirmative side clearly explained that the percentage of salt is 9.09% (or 9.1%), calculated by dividing the mass of salt (10 g) by the total mass of the solution (110 g) and multiplying by 100. The negative side agreed completely with this methodology and calculation, and even reinforced the key point by highlighting a common mistake (calculating 10/100 = 10%). Since both sides are in complete agreement and both have provided the correct answer with proper reasoning, there is no debate to adjudicate. Both sides deserve equal recognition for their accurate analysis.",
