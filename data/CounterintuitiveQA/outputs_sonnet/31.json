    "debate_answer": "1/2",
    "Reason": "The Negative side correctly identifies the critical ambiguity in the problem statement. The phrase 'you see one of them is a boy' implies observing a specific, randomly selected child, not merely knowing that at least one boy exists in the family. When you randomly select and observe one specific child who turns out to be a boy, the other child's gender remains independent with probability 1/2 for each gender. The Affirmative side's analysis would be correct for the question 'given that at least one child is a boy,' but the 'seeing' language suggests a different conditional probability scenario. The Negative side's interpretation aligns better with the natural reading of 'you see one of them' as selecting a particular child to observe, making the unobserved child's gender independent with probability 1/2.",
