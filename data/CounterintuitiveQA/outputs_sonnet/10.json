    "debate_topic": "Suppose we find a murderer's fingerprint at a crime scene. After comparing this fingerprint with 20000 people, the police found a suspect whose fingerprint matches the one at the scene. Now, this suspect is brought to court and accused of being the murderer. The expert in court tells you that the chance of modern fingerprint comparison technology mistaking two people's fingerprints as the same is 0.01%. Assuming that all 20000 people compared by the police are innocent, what is the percentage that at least one match will be produced after the murderer's fingerprint is compared with them one by one?",
    "base_answer": "I need to find the probability that at least one false match occurs when comparing the murderer's fingerprint against 20,000 innocent people.\n\n**Given information:**\n- Number of comparisons: n = 20,000\n- False positive rate (probability of mistakenly matching two different fingerprints): p = 0.01% = 0.0001\n- All 20,000 people are innocent (so any match would be a false positive)\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe probability of at least one false match is:\nP(at least one match) = 1 - P(no matches)\n\nFor each comparison with an innocent person:\n- P(no false match) = 1 - 0.0001 = 0.9999\n\nFor all 20,000 independent comparisons:\n- P(no matches in all comparisons) = (0.9999)^20,000\n\nCalculating:\n- P(no matches) = (0.9999)^20,000\n- Using the approximation: (1-x)^n ≈ e^(-nx) for small x\n- P(no matches) ≈ e^(-0.0001 × 20,000) = e^(-2) ≈ 0.1353\n\nTherefore:\n- P(at least one match) = 1 - 0.1353 = 0.8647\n\n**Answer: Approximately 86.5%**\n\nThis is a striking example of the **prosecutor's fallacy** or the **multiple testing problem**. Even though the false positive rate is very low (0.01%), when you perform 20,000 comparisons, the probability of finding at least one false match becomes quite high (86.5%). This means that finding a match doesn't necessarily mean the suspect is guilty—there's a high chance it could be a false positive from searching through so many people.",
    "debate_answer": "18.13%",
    "Reason": "Both debaters actually agree on the mathematical calculation and arrive at the same answer of approximately 18.13%. The Affirmative side presents a clear, structured mathematical solution using the complement rule: P(at least one false match) = 1 - (0.9999)^20000 ≈ 18.13%. The Negative side acknowledges this calculation is correct and adds valuable context about the prosecutor's fallacy and the importance of additional evidence. However, since the Negative side's position is essentially agreement rather than opposition, and the Affirmative side provided the original complete solution with proper mathematical reasoning, the preference goes to the Affirmative side for presenting the definitive answer first with clear step-by-step logic. The calculation correctly applies probability theory to show that when comparing a fingerprint against 20,000 innocent people with a 0.01% false positive rate per comparison, there is approximately an 18.13% chance of obtaining at least one false match.",
