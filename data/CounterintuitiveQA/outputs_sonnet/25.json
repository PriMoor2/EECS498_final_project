    "Reason": "Both the affirmative and negative sides have reached the same conclusion that the answer is 11. The affirmative side presented a clear, mathematically rigorous proof: if R = (11/10)Y, then Y = (10/11)R, which means the difference R - Y = (1/11)R. The negative side verified this with concrete examples and confirmed the correctness of the affirmative's reasoning. Since both sides agree on the answer and the mathematical logic is sound, there is consensus. The affirmative side is supported as they presented the original correct solution with complete reasoning.",
