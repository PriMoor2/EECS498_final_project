    "base_answer": "I need to find when the man completes 25% of the task, given that he doubles his work each day and finishes in 20 days.\n\nLet me work backwards from day 20.\n\nIf the man completes the entire task (100%) on day 20, and he doubles the work done each day, then:\n- Day 20: 100% complete (full task done)\n- Day 19: 50% complete (half the task done)\n- Day 18: 25% complete (quarter of the task done)\n\nLet me verify this logic:\n- If on day 19 he has 50% done, and he doubles the work on day 20, he would complete the remaining 50%, reaching 100%. ✓\n\nTherefore, it takes **18 days** for the man to complete 25% of the task.",
    "debate_answer": "18 days",
    "Reason": "Both debaters actually arrived at the same answer of 18 days, but the Affirmative side presented a clearer and more confident analysis from the start. The Affirmative's backward-working method (Day 20: 100%, Day 19: 50%, Day 18: 25%) is elegant and intuitive. They also provided mathematical verification using the geometric series formula. The Negative side initially expressed disagreement but then realized they were actually in agreement with the Affirmative's answer and approach. The Negative side's self-correction shows good reasoning, but the Affirmative side demonstrated superior clarity and confidence throughout. Both correctly understood that when work doubles each day, the work done on the final day equals all previous work combined, which is why working backwards by halving gives us the answer. Since both agree on 18 days and the logic is sound, the Affirmative side wins for presenting the clearest initial argument.",
