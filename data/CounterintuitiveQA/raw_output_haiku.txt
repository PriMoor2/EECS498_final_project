The optimal strategy is to use the Secretary Problem or Optimal Stopping Theory approach. The key steps are: 1) Observe the first n/e candidates (where e is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately 2.718) without making any selections. This is the 'exploration' phase. 2) After the exploration phase, start accepting candidates that are better than all the candidates you've seen so far. This is the 'exploitation' phase. The probability of success using this strategy is approximately 1/e, or around 37%, which is the best possible probability for this problem.
