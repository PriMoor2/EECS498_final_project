How long does Alice need to run one circle?",

This means that Alice completes one circle in 4 minutes.\n\nStep 3: Find the time it takes for Alice to run one circle.\nSince the time it takes for Alice to run one circle is the same, regardless of the direction, we can use either the clockwise or counterclockwise time.\n\nTime for Alice to run one circle = 4 minutes\n\nTherefore, Alice needs to run for 4 minutes to complete one circle around the 600-meter circular runway.",
