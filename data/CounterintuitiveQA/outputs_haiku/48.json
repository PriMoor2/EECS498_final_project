    "debate_topic": "Ram used to arrive at the railway station every day at 6 pm from work. As soon as Ram arrived at the station, his wife Sita too arrives at the station by car to pick him up. Both drive back home. One day Ram arrived at the station one hour early and thought of taking a walk back to home. He started walking when after covering a specific distance, he meets with Sita. Both drive back home and this time they reached 30 minutes earlier than the usual time. How long has Ram been walking? It is known that Sita drove every day at a uniform speed.",
    "base_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the time it took for Ram to walk a specific distance and then reach home earlier than the usual time.\n\nGiven information:\n- Ram usually arrives at the railway station at 6 pm.\n- Sita arrives at the station by car to pick him up.\n- One day, Ram arrived at the station one hour early, at 5 pm.\n- After covering a specific distance, he met with Sita.\n- They reached home 30 minutes earlier than the usual time.\n- Sita drives at a uniform speed every day.\n\nLet's assume the following:\n- The time it takes for Sita to drive from the station to their home is t hours.\n- The time it takes for Ram to walk the specific distance is x hours.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the time it takes for Ram and Sita to reach home when Ram arrives at the station at 6 pm.\nTime taken to reach home = t hours\n\nStep 2: Calculate the time it takes for Ram and Sita to reach home when Ram arrives at the station at 5 pm.\nTime taken to reach home = t - 0.5 hours (since they reached home 30 minutes earlier)\n\nStep 3: Calculate the time it takes for Ram to walk the specific distance.\nTime taken to walk the specific distance = x hours\n\nStep 4: Set up an equation to find the value of x.\nTime taken to reach home when Ram arrives at 5 pm = Time taken to walk the specific distance + Time taken for Sita to drive from the meeting point to home\nt - 0.5 = x + (t - x)\nt - 0.5 = t\nx = 0.5 hours\n\nTherefore, Ram has been walking for 0.5 hours (30 minutes).",
    "debate_answer": "Ram was walking for 30 minutes.",
    "Reason": "The Negative side's explanation is more accurate and aligns better with the details provided in the problem statement. They correctly identified that Ram arrived 1 hour early at 5 pm, and they reached home 30 minutes earlier than usual, which means Ram was walking for 30 minutes, not 1 hour.",
