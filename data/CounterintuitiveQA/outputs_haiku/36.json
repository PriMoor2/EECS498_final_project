    "debate_topic": "Alok has three daughters. His friend Shyam wants to know the ages of his daughters. Alok gives him first hint. The product of their ages is 72. Shyam says this is not enough information Alok gives him a second hint. The sum of their ages is equal to my house number. Shyam goes out and looks at the house number and tells “I still do not have enough information to determine the ages”. Alok admits that Shyam can not guess and gives him the third hint The oldest girl likes strawberry ice cream. Shyam is able to guess after the third hint. Can you guess what is the age of the oldest girl?",
    "base_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to use the given hints to find the ages of Alok's three daughters.\n\nGiven information:\n1. The product of their ages is 72.\n2. The sum of their ages is equal to Alok's house number.\n3. The oldest girl likes strawberry ice cream.\n\nStep 1: Find the possible combinations of three numbers whose product is 72.\nThe possible combinations are: (1, 8, 9), (2, 6, 12), (3, 4, 6), (4, 3, 6), (6, 2, 12), (6, 3, 4), (8, 1, 9), (9, 1, 8).\n\nStep 2: Determine the sum of the ages for each combination.\n(1, 8, 9): 1 + 8 + 9 = 18\n(2, 6, 12): 2 + 6 + 12 = 20\n(3, 4, 6): 3 + 4 + 6 = 13\n(4, 3, 6): 4 + 3 + 6 = 13\n(6, 2, 12): 6 + 2 + 12 = 20\n(6, 3, 4): 6 + 3 + 4 = 13\n(8, 1, 9): 8 + 1 + 9 = 18\n(9, 1, 8): 9 + 1 + 8 = 18\n\nStep 3: Identify the combination that matches Alok's house number.\nSince Shyam could not determine the ages after the second hint, the sum of the ages must not be equal to Alok's house number. Therefore, the only possible combination is (6, 3, 4), where the sum of the ages is 13.\n\nStep 4: Determine the age of the oldest girl.\nThe oldest girl is 6 years old, as she is the oldest among the three daughters.\n\nTherefore, the age of the oldest girl is 6 years old.",
    "debate_answer": "The age of the oldest daughter is 12 years old.",
    "Reason": "The affirmative side has provided a more comprehensive and logical analysis of the problem. They have correctly identified that the sum of the ages must be greater than the largest factor of 72, which is 72, since Shyam could not determine the ages from the first two hints. The affirmative side has also correctly deduced that the oldest daughter is likely 12 years old based on the third hint. Their analysis of the possible combinations for the other two daughters is also sound, considering the constraint that the sum of the ages must equal Alok's house number.",
