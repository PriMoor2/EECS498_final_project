After comparing this fingerprint with 20000 people, the police found a suspect whose fingerprint matches the one at the scene. Now, this suspect is brought to court and accused of being the murderer. The expert in court tells you that the chance of modern fingerprint comparison technology mistaking two people's fingerprints as the same is 0.01%. Assuming that all 20000 people compared by the police are innocent, what is the percentage that at least one match will be produced after the murderer's fingerprint is compared with them one by one?",
    "base_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of at least one match occurring when the murderer's fingerprint is compared with 20,000 innocent people.\n\nGiven information:\n- The chance of modern fingerprint comparison technology mistaking two people's fingerprints as the same is 0.01%.\n- All 20,000 people compared by the police are assumed to be innocent.\n\nWe can use the concept of the complement of an event to find the probability of at least one match.\n\nThe probability of at least one match is the complement of the probability of no matches.\n\nThe probability of no matches is the probability that the murderer's fingerprint does not match any of the 20,000 innocent people's fingerprints.\n\nThe probability of no matches = (1 - 0.0001)^20,000 = 0.8187 (approximately)\n\nTherefore, the probability of at least one match is:\nProbability of at least one match = 1 - 0.8187 = 0.1813 or 18.13%\n\nSo, the percentage that at least one match will be produced after the murderer's fingerprint is compared with 20,000 innocent people is approximately 18.13%.",
