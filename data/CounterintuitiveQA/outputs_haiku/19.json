    "debate_topic": "You borrowed a pen from your friend. This pen can write 500 words on average before running out of ink. After writing a 300-word letter to your friend, you want to know how much longer the pen can write. However, your friend told you that this pen writes twice as fast when the pen is warmer, which happened during the first 150 words. How many more words can you write with this pen?",
    "base_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the remaining ink capacity of the pen after writing the 300-word letter, taking into account the different writing speeds during the first 150 words.\n\nGiven information:\n- The pen can write 500 words on average before running out of ink.\n- The first 150 words were written at twice the normal speed.\n- The remaining 150 words were written at the normal speed.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the amount of ink used during the first 150 words.\nSince the pen writes twice as fast during the first 150 words, the amount of ink used is equivalent to 75 words (150 words / 2).\n\nStep 2: Calculate the amount of ink used during the remaining 150 words.\nThe remaining 150 words were written at the normal speed, so the amount of ink used is 150 words.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total amount of ink used in the 300-word letter.\nTotal ink used = Ink used during the first 150 words + Ink used during the remaining 150 words\nTotal ink used = 75 words + 150 words = 225 words\n\nStep 4: Calculate the remaining ink capacity of the pen.\nRemaining ink capacity = Total ink capacity - Total ink used\nRemaining ink capacity = 500 words - 225 words = 275 words\n\nTherefore, the pen can write 275 more words before running out of ink.",
