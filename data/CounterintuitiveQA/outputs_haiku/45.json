    "debate_topic": "Four people need to cross a rickety bridge at night. Unfortunately, they have one torch and the bridge is too dangerous to cross without a torch. The bridge can support only two people at a time. All the people don’t take the same time to cross the bridge. Time for each person: 1 min, 2 mins, 7 mins, and 10 mins. What is the shortest time needed for all four of them to cross the bridge?",
    "base_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal way to cross the bridge with the given constraints and times for each person.\n\nGiven information:\n- The bridge can support only two people at a time.\n- The people have one torch, and the bridge is too dangerous to cross without a torch.\n- The times for each person to cross the bridge are: 1 min, 2 mins, 7 mins, and 10 mins.\n\nThe shortest time needed for all four people to cross the bridge can be found by following these steps:\n\n1. Send the two fastest people (1 min and 2 mins) across the bridge first.\n   - Time taken: 2 mins\n\n2. The person with 1 min time returns with the torch.\n   - Time taken: 1 min\n\n3. Send the two slowest people (7 mins and 10 mins) across the bridge.\n   - Time taken: 10 mins\n\n4. The person with 2 mins time returns with the torch.\n   - Time taken: 2 mins\n\n5. Send the two fastest people (1 min and 2 mins) across the bridge again.\n   - Time taken: 2 mins\n\nTotal time taken: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 mins\n\nTherefore, the shortest time needed for all four people to cross the bridge is 17 minutes.",
    "debate_answer": "The shortest time needed for all four people to cross the bridge is 22 minutes, using the negative side's proposed solution.",
    "Reason": "The negative side's solution is more optimal as it reduces the total time required for the slower people to cross the bridge. By sending the faster person (1 min) with the slower person (7 min), the total time is reduced by 3 minutes compared to the affirmative side's solution.",
