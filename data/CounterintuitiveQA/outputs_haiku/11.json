With a larger number of possible pairs, the probability of at least two people having the same birthday increases.\n\nSpecifically, the formula for the probability that at least two people in a group of n people have the same birthday is:\n\nP(at least two people have the same birthday) = 1 - (365! / (365^n * (365 - n)!))\n\nWhere n is the number of people in the room.\n\nSolving this equation for a probability greater than 50%, we find that the minimum number of people required in the room is 23.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that 23 people need to be in a room to make the probability that at least two people have the same birthday exceed 50%.",
