Observe the first n/e (approximately 37%) of the candidates, where n is the total number of candidates (in this case, 100).\n2. During this observation phase, do not accept any candidate.\n3. After the observation phase, start accepting the next candidate who is better than all the candidates you have observed so far.\n\nProbability of Success:\n\nThe probability of accepting the best candidate using this strategy is approximately 1/e, which is around 37%.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe reasoning behind this strategy is as follows:\n\n1. The observation phase allows you to get a sense of the distribution of the candidates' rankings. By observing the first 37% of the candidates, you can estimate the quality of the best candidate.\n2. After the observation phase, you start accepting the next candidate who is better than all the candidates you have observed so far. This ensures that you accept the best candidate among the remaining 63% of the candidates.\n\nThe probability of success is 1/e (approximately 37%) because the optimal stopping point is when the next candidate is better than all the previously observed candidates, which happens, on average, once every e (approximately 2.718) candidates.\n\nThis strategy is optimal because it balances the need to observe a sufficient number of candidates to estimate the quality of the best candidate, while also maximizing the probability of accepting the best candidate among the remaining candidates.",

Divide the 100 candidates into 10 groups of 10 candidates each.\n2. Examine the first candidate from each group and keep track of the best candidate seen so far.\n3. After examining the first candidate from all 10 groups, select the best candidate among those 10.\n\nThe reasoning behind this strategy is:\n\n1.

Selecting the best candidate among the 10 group representatives gives us a higher probability of choosing the overall best candidate, compared to the Secretary Problem strategy.\n\nThe probability of success using this strategy can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe probability of selecting the best candidate among the 10 group representatives is 10/100 = 0.1.\nThe probability that the best candidate is among the 10 group representatives is (90/100) * (89/99) * ... * (81/91) ≈ 0.9048.\n\nTherefore, the overall probability of success is approximately 0.1 * 0.9048 = 0.0905, or around 9.05%.\n\nWhile this probability is lower than the 37% achieved by the Secretary Problem strategy, I believe this approach offers some advantages:\n\n1.
