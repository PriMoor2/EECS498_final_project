    "base_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Ankur's brother has two boys, given that one of the children was born on a Tuesday.\n\nGiven information:\n- Ankur's brother has two offsprings.\n- One of the children was born on Tuesday.\n- Assume an equal chance of giving birth to either sex (boy or girl).\n- Assume an equal chance of giving birth on any day of the week.\n\nTo find the probability that Ankur's brother has two boys, we need to consider the possible outcomes.\n\nThere are four possible outcomes for the two children:\n1. Two boys\n2. Two girls\n3. One boy and one girl\n4. One girl and one boy\n\nSince we know that one of the children was born on Tuesday, we can eliminate the third and fourth outcomes, as they would not result in two boys.\n\nThe probability of having two boys is 1/2, as there are two possible outcomes (two boys or two girls) and the probability of each outcome is equal.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the condition that one of the children was born on Tuesday. The probability of a child being born on any day of the week is 1/7 (assuming an equal chance of giving birth on any day).\n\nThe probability that the first child was born on Tuesday and the second child was also a boy is:\nProbability of the first child being a boy × Probability of the first child being born on Tuesday × Probability of the second child being a boy\n= 1/2 × 1/7 × 1/2 = 1/28\n\nTherefore, the probability that Ankur's brother has two boys, given that one of the children was born on Tuesday, is 1/28.",
    "debate_answer": "The probability that Ankur's brother has two boys is 1/2 or 50%.",
    "Reason": "Both the affirmative and negative sides have provided a clear and logical step-by-step analysis of the problem, and have arrived at the same final probability of 50% that Ankur's brother has two boys. The reasoning provided by both sides is sound and consistent with the given information. Therefore, I support the affirmative side as the correct answer.",
