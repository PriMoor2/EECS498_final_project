The players then flip a large coin a number of times and record each of the individual flips. Here, H stands for heads and T stands for tails. After the flips, they pay attention to the record of flips and decide which pattern came first in the sequence. If HTH came before HHT, player A won the game, otherwise, B won the game. What is the probability that player B won this game?",
    "base_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that the pattern HHT appears before the pattern HTH in a sequence of coin flips.\n\nGiven information:\n- The coin is fair, meaning the probability of getting heads (H) or tails (T) on each flip is 0.5.\n- The players are looking for the patterns HTH and HHT in the sequence of coin flips.\n- If HTH appears before HHT, player A wins; otherwise, player B wins.\n\nTo find the probability that player B wins, we need to find the probability that the pattern HHT appears before the pattern HTH.\n\nThe probability of getting a specific sequence of coin flips can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each individual flip.\n\nThe probability of getting the pattern HTH is:\nP(HTH) = 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.125\n\nThe probability of getting the pattern HHT is:\nP(HHT) = 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.125\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that HHT appears before HTH in the sequence of coin flips.\n\nThe probability that HHT appears before HTH is the probability that the first three flips are HHT, plus the probability that the first four flips are HHTX (where X can be H or T), plus the probability that the first five flips are HHTTX (where X can be H or T), and so on.\n\nThe probability that HHT appears before HTH can be calculated as:\nP(HHT before HTH) = P(HHT) + P(HHTX) + P(HHTTX) + ...\nP(HHT before HTH) = 0.125 + 0.125 × 0.5 + 0.125 × 0.5 × 0.5 + ...\nP(HHT before HTH) = 0.125 / (1 - 0.5) = 0.25\n\nTherefore, the probability that player B wins the game is 0.25 or 25%.",
