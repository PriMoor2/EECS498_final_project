    "debate_topic": "You have 100 chairs in a row. You start by flipping every chair (1, 2, 3, ..., 100) from its initial position. Then, you flip every second chair (2, 4, 6, ..., 100). Next, you flip every third chair (3, 6, 9, ..., 99). You continue this process until you flip every 100th chair (only chair 100). How many chairs are flipped back to their initial position after all the flips?",
    "base_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the flips and how it affects the final position of the chairs.\n\nGiven information:\n- There are 100 chairs in a row.\n- You start by flipping every chair (1, 2, 3, ..., 100) from its initial position.\n- Then, you flip every second chair (2, 4, 6, ..., 100).\n- Next, you flip every third chair (3, 6, 9, ..., 99).\n- You continue this process until you flip every 100th chair (only chair 100).\n\nTo determine the number of chairs that are flipped back to their initial position, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. After the first flip, all chairs are in the opposite position.\n2. When you flip every second chair, the chairs that were initially in the opposite position are flipped back to their initial position.\n3. When you flip every third chair, the chairs that were initially in the opposite position are flipped back to their initial position.\n4. This pattern continues until you flip every 100th chair.\n\nThe chairs that are flipped back to their initial position are the ones that are divisible by their flip number.\n\nFor example:\n- Chairs flipped back to their initial position after the second flip: 2, 4, 6, ..., 100\n- Chairs flipped back to their initial position after the third flip: 3, 6, 9, ..., 99\n- Chairs flipped back to their initial position after the fourth flip: 4, 8, 12, ..., 100\n- And so on, until the 100th flip, which only affects chair 100.\n\nTo find the total number of chairs flipped back to their initial position, we need to count the number of chairs that are divisible by 1, 2, 3, ..., 100.\n\nThe number of chairs flipped back to their initial position is the sum of the divisors of 100, excluding 100 itself (since chair 100 is only flipped once).\n\nThe divisors of 100 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.\n\nTherefore, the number of chairs flipped back to their initial position is 9 (1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 25 + 50).\n\nSo, the answer is 9 chairs.",
