    "base_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.\n\nGiven information:\n- The family has two children.\n- The possible combinations of the children are: brothers, sisters, big brother and little sister, or big sister and little brother.\n- Each combination has an equal probability of occurring.\n- We are given that one of the children is a boy.\n\nWe want to find the probability that the other child is also a boy.\n\nLet's define the events:\n- A: The other child is a boy.\n- B: One of the children is a boy.\n\nWe want to find P(A|B), the probability that the other child is a boy, given that one of the children is a boy.\n\nUsing the formula for conditional probability:\nP(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n\nWe can calculate the probabilities as follows:\nP(A and B) = P(both children are boys) = 1/4 (since there are 4 equally likely outcomes)\nP(B) = P(one child is a boy) = 3/4 (since there are 3 outcomes where one child is a boy)\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\nP(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\nP(A|B) = (1/4) / (3/4)\nP(A|B) = 1/3\n\nTherefore, the probability that the other child is a boy, given that one of the children is a boy, is 1/3 or approximately 0.333.",
