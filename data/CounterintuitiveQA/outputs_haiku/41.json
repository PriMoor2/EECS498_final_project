What is the maximum distance the car can travel before you are forced to buy a new tyre? You are allowed to change tyres (using the spare tyre) an unlimited number of times.",
    "base_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum distance the car can travel before all the tyres (including the spare tyre) wear off.\n\nGiven information:\n- The car has 4 tyres and 1 spare tyre.\n- Each tyre can travel a maximum distance of 20,000 miles before wearing off.\n- You are allowed to change the tyres (using the spare tyre) an unlimited number of times.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total distance the car can travel with the 5 tyres (4 regular tyres and 1 spare tyre).\nTotal distance = 5 × 20,000 miles = 100,000 miles\n\nTherefore, the maximum distance the car can travel before you are forced to buy a new tyre is 100,000 miles.\n\nExplanation:\n- The car starts with 4 regular tyres and 1 spare tyre.\n- As the regular tyres wear off, you can replace them with the spare tyre.\n- Once all 5 tyres have worn off, you will need to buy a new set of tyres.\n- Since you can change the tyres an unlimited number of times, the car can travel a maximum distance of 100,000 miles (5 × 20,000 miles) before you need to buy a new tyre.",
    "debate_answer": "80,000 miles",
    "Reason": "Both the affirmative and negative sides have presented a clear and well-reasoned analysis of the problem. They have correctly identified the key factors, such as the number of tires, the maximum distance per tire, and the ability to replace tires using the spare. The affirmative side has provided a step-by-step explanation that logically leads to the final answer of 80,000 miles as the maximum distance the car can travel. The negative side has concurred with this analysis and reasoning. Therefore, I believe the affirmative side has presented the correct answer and supporting arguments.",
