    "base_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the pattern of the task completion and then calculate the number of days it took to complete 25% of the task.\n\nGiven information:\n- The man doubles the task done every day.\n- The man completes the entire task in 20 days.\n\nLet's assume the total task is represented by 100%.\n\nOn the first day, the man completes 1% of the task.\nOn the second day, the man completes 2% of the task (1% × 2).\nOn the third day, the man completes 4% of the task (2% × 2).\nAnd so on, the task completed doubles each day.\n\nWe can represent the task completion as follows:\nDay 1: 1%\nDay 2: 2%\nDay 3: 4%\nDay 4: 8%\nDay 5: 16%\nDay 6: 32%\nDay 7: 64%\nDay 8: 100%\n\nSince the man completes the entire task in 20 days, we can see that on the 8th day, he has completed 100% of the task.\n\nNow, to find the number of days it took to complete 25% of the task, we need to find the day when the task completed reached 25%.\n\nFrom the pattern, we can see that on the 7th day, the task completed is 64%, which is more than 25%.\nOn the 6th day, the task completed is 32%, which is less than 25%.\n\nTherefore, the man completed 25% of the task on the 6th day.\n\nSo, it took the man 6 days to complete 25% of the task.",
