    "debate_topic": "100 people are boarding a plane in a line and each of them is assigned to one of the 100 seats on a plane. However, the first person in line forgot his boarding pass and as a result decided to sit down in a random seat. The second person will do the following: Sit in her seat if it still available. If her seat is not available, choose a random seat among the seats remaining and sit there. Each following person sits according to the same rules as the second person. What is the probability the 100th person will be able to sit in her assigned seat?",
    "base_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability that the 100th person will be able to sit in her assigned seat.\n\nGiven information:\n- There are 100 people boarding a plane with 100 seats.\n- The first person sits in a random seat.\n- The second person sits in her assigned seat if it is available, or chooses a random seat among the remaining seats if her assigned seat is not available.\n- Each following person sits according to the same rules as the second person.\n\nTo calculate the probability that the 100th person will be able to sit in her assigned seat, we need to consider the possible scenarios that can occur.\n\nScenario 1: The 100th person's assigned seat is available.\nThis can happen if all the previous 99 people were able to sit in their assigned seats. The probability of this scenario is:\nProbability = (99/100) × (98/99) × ... × (1/2) × (1/1) = 1/100\n\nScenario 2: The 100th person's assigned seat is not available.\nThis can happen if at least one of the previous 99 people did not sit in their assigned seat. The probability of this scenario is:\nProbability = 1 - (1/100) = 99/100\n\nTherefore, the probability that the 100th person will be able to sit in her assigned seat is the probability of Scenario 1, which is 1/100 or 1%.",
    "debate_answer": "The probability that the 100th person will be able to sit in their assigned seat is 1/100 or 1%.",
    "Reason": "The negative side's analysis is more accurate. The probability that the 100th person's seat is available depends on the outcomes of the previous 99 people, not just the 100th person's seat in isolation. The negative side's calculation of (99! / 100!) = 1/100 is the correct probability.",
