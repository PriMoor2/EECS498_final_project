    "base_answer": "To maximize the chance of picking a white ball, you should distribute the balls in such a way that one bowl contains all the white balls and the other bowl contains all the black balls.\n\nHere's how you should distribute the balls:\n\n1. Place all 50 white balls in one of the empty bowls.\n2. Place all 50 black balls in the other empty bowl.\n\nBy doing this, the probability of picking a white ball is 1, as the bowl containing the white balls will be selected with a 50% chance, and the ball picked from that bowl will always be white.\n\nThe probability of picking a white ball can be calculated as follows:\n\nProbability of picking a white ball = (Number of white balls / Total number of balls) × Probability of selecting the bowl with white balls\nProbability of picking a white ball = (50 / 100) × 0.5 = 0.5 or 50%\n\nThis is the maximum possible probability of picking a white ball, as it ensures that all the white balls are in one bowl, and the selection of the bowl is random.",
    "debate_answer": "The optimal strategy to maximize the chance of picking a white ball is to evenly distribute the 50 white and 50 black balls into the two bowls, putting 25 of each color in each bowl.",
    "Reason": "The affirmative side has presented a clear and logical step-by-step reasoning that leads to the optimal solution of evenly distributing the 50 white and 50 black balls into the two bowls. Their analysis demonstrates that this strategy maximizes the probability of picking a white ball, regardless of which bowl is selected. The negative side has agreed with the affirmative's conclusion, further reinforcing that this is the correct answer.",
