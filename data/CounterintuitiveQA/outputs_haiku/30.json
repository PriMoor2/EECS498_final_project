However, the breathalyzers never fail to detect a truly drunk person. One in a thousand drivers is driving drunk. Suppose the police officers then stop a driver at random, and force the driver to take a breathalyzer test. It indicates that the driver is drunk. We assume you don't know anything else about him or her. How high is the probability he or she really is drunk?",
    "base_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the events involved.\n\nGiven information:\n- The breathalyzers display false drunkenness in 5% of the cases where the driver is sober.\n- The breathalyzers never fail to detect a truly drunk person.\n- One in a thousand drivers is driving drunk.\n- The breathalyzer test indicates that the driver is drunk.\n\nLet's define the following events:\n- A: The driver is drunk.\n- B: The breathalyzer test indicates the driver is drunk.\n\nWe want to find the probability that the driver is really drunk, given that the breathalyzer test indicates the driver is drunk, P(A|B).\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem:\nP(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n\nStep 1: Calculate P(B|A)\nP(B|A) = 1, since the breathalyzers never fail to detect a truly drunk person.\n\nStep 2: Calculate P(A)\nP(A) = 1/1000 = 0.001, since one in a thousand drivers is driving drunk.\n\nStep 3: Calculate P(B)\nP(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)\nP(B) = 1 * 0.001 + 0.05 * 0.999 = 0.051\n\nStep 4: Calculate P(A|B)\nP(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\nP(A|B) = (1 * 0.001) / 0.051 = 0.0196 or approximately 1.96%\n\nTherefore, the probability that the driver is really drunk, given that the breathalyzer test indicates the driver is drunk, is approximately 1.96%.",
