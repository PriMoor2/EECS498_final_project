Due to the hot and dry climate of the desert, the water content of the watermelons decreases from 99% to 98%. What is the current weight of the watermelons?",
    "base_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of the watermelons after the water content has decreased from 99% to 98%.\n\nGiven information:\n- The initial weight of the watermelons is 100 kilograms.\n- The water content of the watermelons decreases from 99% to 98%.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the initial weight of the water in the watermelons.\nInitial weight of water = 99% of 100 kilograms = 0.99 × 100 = 99 kilograms\n\nStep 2: Calculate the final weight of the water in the watermelons.\nFinal weight of water = 98% of 100 kilograms = 0.98 × 100 = 98 kilograms\n\nStep 3: Calculate the final weight of the watermelons.\nFinal weight of watermelons = Initial weight of watermelons - (Initial weight of water - Final weight of water)\nFinal weight of watermelons = 100 kilograms - (99 kilograms - 98 kilograms)\nFinal weight of watermelons = 100 kilograms - 1 kilogram = 99 kilograms\n\nTherefore, the current weight of the watermelons is 99 kilograms.",
