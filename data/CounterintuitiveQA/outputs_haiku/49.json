    "debate_topic": "On an Island, there is an airport that has an unlimited number of identical air-planes. Each air-plane has a fuel capacity to allow it to fly exactly 1/2 way around the world, along a great circle. The planes have the ability to refuel in flight without loss of speed or spillage of fuel. Though the fuel is unlimited, the island is the only source of fuel. You can ignore the time and fuel consumption of refuelling. What is the minimum number of air-planes required to get one air plane all the way around the world assuming that all of the air planes must return safely to the airport?",
    "base_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of airplanes required to fly one airplane all the way around the world and return safely to the airport.\n\nGiven information:\n- The airplanes have a fuel capacity to fly exactly 1/2 way around the world.\n- The airplanes can refuel in flight without any loss of speed or fuel.\n- The island is the only source of fuel.\n- All the airplanes must return safely to the airport.\n\nTo get one airplane all the way around the world, it needs to be refueled at least once. Since each airplane can fly 1/2 way around the world, we need at least two airplanes to complete the full circle.\n\nThe minimum number of airplanes required is 3:\n\n1. The first airplane flies 1/2 way around the world and then returns to the airport.\n2. The second airplane flies the remaining 1/2 way around the world and then returns to the airport.\n3. The third airplane flies all the way around the world and returns to the airport.\n\nThis way, all three airplanes return safely to the airport, and the minimum number of airplanes required is 3.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of airplanes required to get one airplane all the way around the world and return safely to the airport is 3.",
    "debate_answer": "The minimum number of planes required to get one plane all the way around the world, assuming all planes must return safely to the airport, is 2.",
    "Reason": "The negative side's argument is more convincing. They have demonstrated that the minimum number of planes required is 2, not 3. The key insight is that the planes can refuel each other in mid-air without the need for an additional plane to assist with the return trip. This makes the negative side's logic more sound and efficient.",
