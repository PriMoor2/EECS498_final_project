The technology has a reliability of 95%, meaning that 95% of true criminals are identified as criminals, and 95% of innocent people are identified as innocent. What is the percentage that a person identified as a criminal by the technology is indeed a criminal?",
    "base_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the events involved.\n\nGiven information:\n- The city has a population of 1 million inhabitants.\n- There are 100 known criminals.\n- The crime prediction technology has a reliability of 95%.\n\nLet's define the following events:\n- A: A person is a criminal.\n- B: A person is identified as a criminal by the technology.\n\nWe want to find the probability that a person identified as a criminal is indeed a criminal, which is P(A|B).\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem:\nP(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n\nStep 1: Calculate P(B|A).\nP(B|A) = 0.95 (since the technology correctly identifies 95% of true criminals)\n\nStep 2: Calculate P(A).\nP(A) = Number of criminals / Total population = 100 / 1,000,000 = 0.0001\n\nStep 3: Calculate P(B).\nP(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)\nP(B|not A) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 (since the technology incorrectly identifies 5% of innocent people as criminals)\nP(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.9999\nP(B) = 0.95 * 0.0001 + 0.05 * 0.9999 = 0.0499995\n\nStep 4: Calculate P(A|B).\nP(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\nP(A|B) = (0.95 * 0.0001) / 0.0499995 = 0.0019 = 0.19%\n\nTherefore, the percentage that a person identified as a criminal by the technology is indeed a criminal is approximately 0.19%.",
