What is the least number of days you'd need to draw cards in order for you to have a greater than 50% chance of drawing the Ace of Spades at least once?",
    "base_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the least number of days required to have a greater than 50% chance of drawing the Ace of Spades at least once.\n\nGiven information:\n- The pack of playing cards has 52 cards.\n- You draw one card every day and put it back into the pack, shuffling it.\n\nThe probability of drawing the Ace of Spades on any given day is 1/52, as there is only one Ace of Spades in the pack.\n\nTo find the least number of days required, we need to calculate the probability of not drawing the Ace of Spades in a certain number of days and then find the number of days where the probability of drawing the Ace of Spades at least once is greater than 50%.\n\nThe probability of not drawing the Ace of Spades in a single day is 51/52.\nThe probability of not drawing the Ace of Spades in n days is (51/52)^n.\n\nThe probability of drawing the Ace of Spades at least once in n days is 1 - (51/52)^n.\n\nWe want to find the least number of days n such that 1 - (51/52)^n > 0.5.\n\nSolving this inequality, we get:\n1 - (51/52)^n > 0.5\n(51/52)^n < 0.5\nn > log(0.5) / log(51/52)\nn > 36.12\n\nSince we need an integer number of days, the least number of days required is 37 days.\n\nTherefore, the least number of days you'd need to draw cards in order to have a greater than 50% chance of drawing the Ace of Spades at least once is 37 days.",
