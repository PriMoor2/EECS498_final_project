    "base_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of probability and the given information.\n\nGiven information:\n- In thirty minutes on a deserted road, there is a 95% chance of seeing a vehicle.\n\nWe need to find the probabilities of seeing a vehicle in ten minutes.\n\nTo do this, we can make the following assumptions:\n1. The probability of seeing a vehicle is evenly distributed over time.\n2. The probability of seeing a vehicle in a given time interval is independent of the probability in other time intervals.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the probability of seeing a vehicle in one minute.\nProbability of seeing a vehicle in one minute = 95% / 30 minutes = 0.0317 or 3.17%\n\nStep 2: Calculate the probability of seeing a vehicle in ten minutes.\nProbability of seeing a vehicle in ten minutes = 10 × 0.0317 = 0.317 or 31.7%\n\nTherefore, the probability of seeing a vehicle in ten minutes on a deserted road is approximately 31.7%.",
