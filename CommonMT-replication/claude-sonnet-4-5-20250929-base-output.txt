The hair is very long
Will not come tomorrow
His/Her hand is clean
He fell down
My heart sank
Something is fishy
He/She touched the sky
Yesterday I was very behind
Her/His eyes opened
our hands and feet swelled up,
Is the apple of one's eye
He is counting drop by drop
He is sitting idle
He left / He went away / He has gone
He went up
He went to be with God
I am feeling cold.
It is heavy
His/Her heart is big
It is clean
It is light
He is straight
He spoke in a loud voice
He/She/It is big.
His/Her face fell
He is driving
He doesn
His/Her mood is bad
He got burned
It is open
It broke in my hands
His/Her face is glowing
He/She/It moved
This is a big matter
He/She is not feeling well.
He is walking
It is empty
His/Her mind is empty
That is heavy work
He is a fallen man
He/She is sharp-minded.
He/She spoke in a soft voice
He speaks loudly
He stands on his own feet
heart burning
He/She is crazy
He/She was left speechless
She/He/That is a big fish
He is flying too high in the air
He/She has butterflies in his/her stomach
