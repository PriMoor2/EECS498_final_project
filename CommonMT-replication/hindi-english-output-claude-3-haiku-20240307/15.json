Contextual meaning: In many Indian religious and cultural contexts, the phrase \"भगवान के पास जाना\" (to go to God) is often used to refer to someone passing away or departing this world to be with the divine. It suggests the person has died and gone to the realm of the divine or the afterlife.\n\n2. Idiomatic usage: The Hindi phrase \"चला गया\" is commonly used in the context of someone's death or passing away. It conveys the idea of the person departing or leaving this world.\n\n3. Nuance and connotation: The translation \"He went to God\" may not fully capture the nuance and connotation of the original Hindi text. \"Passing away\" or \"departing this world\" better reflects the spiritual and religious undertones implied in the Hindi phrase.\n\n4. Consistency with cultural and religious beliefs: In many Indian belief systems, the concept of the soul or the essence of a person going to the divine realm after death is a common theme. Translating it as \"He passed away\" aligns better with this cultural and religious context.\n\nWhile \"He went to God\" is a valid literal translation, I believe \"He passed away\" more accurately captures the intended meaning and connotation of the Hindi text within the relevant cultural and religious framework.\n\nThe translation should prioritize conveying the deeper meaning and nuance of the original text, rather than a strictly literal interpretation. Therefore, I propose \"He passed away\" as the more appropriate English translation."
