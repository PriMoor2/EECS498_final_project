The subject is \"her eyes,\" and the verb \"खुल गईं\" means \"opened\" or \"became open.\"\n\n2. Contextual appropriateness: The phrase suggests a situation where someone's eyes, which were previously closed, have now opened. \"Her eyes opened\" captures this change of state accurately and naturally in English.\n\n3. Idiomatic equivalence: The English phrase \"Her eyes opened\" is a common and idiomatic way to express the same meaning as the Hindi text. It is a natural and fluent translation that conveys the intended meaning effectively.\n\n4. Grammatical structure: The Hindi sentence structure with the subject, verb, and object aligns well with the English translation \"Her eyes opened,\" maintaining the proper grammatical flow.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that \"Her eyes opened\" is the correct and most appropriate English translation of the given Hindi text \"उसकी आँखें खुल गईं.\" The translation accurately captures the meaning, structure, and idiomatic usage in the target language.

While I appreciate your well-reasoned argument, I respectfully disagree with your translation of the Hindi text \"उसकी आँखें खुल गईं.\" In my opinion, the more accurate English translation would be \"Her eyes were opened.\"\n\nHere is my reasoning:\n\n1.

The English translation \"Her eyes were opened\" better captures this nuance of the verb tense and voice.\n\n2. Contextual implications: The phrase \"Her eyes were opened\" implies that something or someone caused the eyes to open, rather than the eyes opening of their own accord. This subtle difference in meaning may be important depending on the context of the original Hindi text.\n\n3. Idiomatic usage: While \"Her eyes opened\" is a valid translation, the phrase \"Her eyes were opened\" is more commonly used in English to express a similar meaning, particularly when conveying a sense of passivity or external influence.\n\n4. Grammatical structure: The Hindi sentence structure with the subject, verb, and object can be more accurately represented in English using the passive voice construction \"Her eyes were opened.\"\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that \"Her eyes were opened\" is a more precise and contextually appropriate English translation of the Hindi text \"उसकी आँखें खुल गईं.\" The passive voice better captures the nuances of the original phrase and aligns more closely with common idiomatic usage in the target language.
