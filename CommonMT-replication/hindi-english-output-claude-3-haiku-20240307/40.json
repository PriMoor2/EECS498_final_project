I believe the correct English translation of the given Hindi text \"वह तेज दिमाग वाला है\" is \"He is sharp-minded.\"\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. Literal translation: The Hindi phrase \"तेज दिमाग\" translates directly to \"sharp mind\" or \"quick intellect.\" The word \"तेज\" means \"sharp\" or \"quick,\" and \"दिमाग\" means \"mind\" or \"intellect.\"\n\n2. Contextual meaning: In the given sentence structure, \"वह तेज दिमाग वाला है\" is describing a person's mental capabilities. The phrase \"वाला है\" indicates a characteristic or quality of the person being described. Therefore, the most appropriate English translation would be to convey the idea of the person having a sharp or quick mind.\n\n3. Idiomatic expression: The phrase \"sharp-minded\" is a common idiomatic expression in English that captures the essence of the Hindi text. It conveys the meaning of someone being intelligent, perceptive, and quick-witted.\n\n4. Grammatical structure: The English translation \"He is sharp-minded\" maintains the same grammatical structure as the original Hindi sentence, with the subject \"he\" and the descriptive phrase \"sharp-minded.\"\n\nIn conclusion, I believe \"He is sharp-minded\" is the most accurate and natural English translation of the given Hindi text \"वह तेज दिमाग वाला है.\" The translation captures the literal meaning, the contextual implication, and the idiomatic expression in a grammatically correct manner."

While I appreciate your reasoning, I believe the correct English translation of the given Hindi text \"वह तेज दिमाग वाला है\" is \"He has a sharp mind.\"\n\nHere's my rationale:\n\n1. Literal translation: You are correct that the Hindi phrase \"तेज दिमाग\" translates directly to \"sharp mind\" or \"quick intellect.\" However, the structure of the full sentence \"वह तेज दिमाग वाला है\" is better captured by the English translation \"He has a sharp mind.\"\n\n2. Grammatical structure: The Hindi sentence structure uses the phrase \"वाला है\" to indicate a characteristic or quality of the person being described. In English, this is more accurately conveyed by the construction \"He has a [quality]\" rather than using the adjective form \"sharp-minded.\"\n\n3. Emphasis on possession: By using the phrase \"He has a sharp mind,\" the translation emphasizes that the person possesses the quality of a sharp mind, rather than simply describing them as \"sharp-minded.\" This subtle difference in emphasis is important for capturing the nuance of the original Hindi text.\n\n4. Idiomatic expression: While \"sharp-minded\" is a common idiomatic expression in English, \"He has a sharp mind\" is also a natural and widely used phrase that conveys the same meaning. It may be more direct and clear in this context.\n\n5. Consistency with other translations: Examining other translations of similar Hindi phrases, the construction \"He has a [quality]\" is often used to convey the meaning more accurately than the adjectival form.\n\nIn conclusion, while your translation of \"He is sharp-minded\" is a valid interpretation, I believe \"He has a sharp mind\" is a more precise and nuanced English translation that better captures the structure and meaning of the original Hindi text \"वह तेज दिमाग वाला है.\" The emphasis on possession and the grammatical structure make this translation more accurate and natural in the English language."
