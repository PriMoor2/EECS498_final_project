The phrase 'His mind is blank' better captures the nuanced meaning of the Hindi phrase 'उसका दिमाग ख़ाली है', conveying the idea of the person's mind being in a state of blankness or lack of mental engagement, rather than just being 'empty'. The negative side's points about the idiomatic usage and grammatical structure also support 'His mind is blank' as the more accurate translation.",

Literal translation: The Hindi phrase \"उसका दिमाग ख़ाली है\" translates directly to \"His mind is empty\" in English.\n\n2. Contextual meaning: The phrase \"उसका दिमाग ख़ाली है\" suggests that the person's mind is vacant, devoid of thoughts or ideas. \"His mind is empty\" accurately captures this connotation in English.\n\n3. Idiomatic expression: In both Hindi and English, the phrase \"mind is empty\" is an idiomatic expression used to convey that someone is lacking in knowledge, intelligence, or mental engagement. This makes \"His mind is empty\" the most appropriate and natural translation.\n\n4. Grammatical structure: The Hindi sentence structure, with the possessive \"उसका\" (his) and the adjective \"ख़ाली\" (empty) modifying the noun \"दिमाग\" (mind), directly translates to the English sentence structure \"His mind is empty.\"\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that \"His mind is empty\" is the correct and most accurate English translation of the given Hindi text. The literal meaning, contextual understanding, idiomatic usage, and grammatical structure all support this translation.
