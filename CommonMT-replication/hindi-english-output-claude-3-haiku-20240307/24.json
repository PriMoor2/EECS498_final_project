    "Reason": "Both translations provided by the debaters are reasonable and capture the essence of the Hindi phrase 'उसका चेहरा उतर गया'. However, I believe the translation 'His face fell' provided by the affirmative side is the more accurate and appropriate choice. The idiomatic usage of 'His face fell' in English better conveys the intended meaning of the Hindi phrase, which is a change in the person's facial expression and emotional state to one of disappointment, sadness, or dejection. The affirmative side's reasoning on the literal translation, idiomatic meaning, contextual appropriateness, and nuance of the expression is more convincing. While the negative side's suggestion of 'His countenance dropped' is also valid, 'His face fell' is a more common and natural way to express the intended meaning in English.",

Literal translation: The Hindi phrase \"उसका चेहरा उतर गया\" can be literally translated as \"His face descended/went down.\" This suggests a more subtle change in the person's facial expression or demeanor, rather than a sudden or dramatic \"falling\" of the face.\n\n2. Nuance and connotation: The word \"countenance\" in English better captures the broader meaning of \"चेहरा\" in Hindi, which encompasses the overall facial expression, demeanor, and bearing of a person. \"His face fell\" implies a more abrupt and pronounced change, whereas \"His countenance dropped\" suggests a more gradual and subtle shift in the person's outward appearance.\n\n3. Contextual appropriateness: The phrase \"His countenance dropped\" is more precise and evocative in conveying the intended meaning of the Hindi phrase. It suggests a change in the person's overall demeanor and emotional state, without the more dramatic connotation of \"His face fell.\"\n\n4. Idiomatic usage: While \"His face fell\" is a common English idiom, \"His countenance dropped\" is also a well-established and idiomatic way of expressing a similar change in a person's facial expression and emotional state. It may be less frequently used, but it is still a valid and appropriate translation.\n\nIn conclusion, while \"His face fell\" is a reasonable translation, I believe \"His countenance dropped\" more accurately captures the nuanced meaning and connotation of the original Hindi phrase \"उसका चेहरा उतर गया.\" The use of the word \"countenance\" better reflects the broader change in the person's overall demeanor and emotional state."
