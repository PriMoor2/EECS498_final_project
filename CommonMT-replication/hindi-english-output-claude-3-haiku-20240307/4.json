In my view, the correct English translation of the Hindi phrase \"दिल बैठ गया\" is \"My heart settled down\" or \"My heart became calm/peaceful\".\n\nHere are my reasons for this translation:\n\n1. Literal meaning: The Hindi phrase \"दिल बैठ गया\" literally translates to \"the heart sat down/settled\". This suggests a sense of the heart or emotions becoming still, calm, or at peace, rather than a feeling of sinking, disappointment, or dejection.\n\n2. Contextual usage: In Hindi, this phrase is often used to convey a sense of relief, contentment, or inner tranquility after a period of anxiety, tension, or unease. It indicates that the person's heart/emotions have found a state of rest or equilibrium.\n\n3. Nuanced connotation: The word \"बैठ गया\" implies a sense of the heart/emotions settling down or coming to a resting state, rather than a sudden plunge or sinking feeling. This conveys a more positive, calming connotation compared to the feeling of disappointment or discouragement.\n\n4. Idiomatic expression: In Hindi, \"दिल बैठ गया\" is an established idiomatic expression that is distinct from phrases that convey a sense of sadness or dejection, such as \"दिल टूट गया\" (my heart broke) or \"दिल दुखी हो गया\" (my heart became sad).\n\nTherefore, based on the literal meaning, contextual usage, and idiomatic nature of the phrase, I believe the correct English translation of \"दिल बैठ गया\" is \"My heart settled down\" or \"My heart became calm/peaceful\". I hope I have provided a convincing argument for my translation. Please feel free to share your perspective."

Literal meaning: While the literal translation of \"दिल बैठ गया\" is \"the heart sat down/settled,\" the connotation in Hindi is one of a sinking or dropping feeling, rather than a sense of calm or tranquility. The use of the verb \"बैठ गया\" suggests a downward movement or a decline in emotional state.\n\n2. Contextual usage: In Hindi, this phrase is often used to convey a sense of disappointment, discouragement, or a heavy heart. It indicates that the person's emotions have taken a turn for the worse, rather than a state of relief or contentment.\n\n3. Nuanced connotation: The phrase \"दिल बैठ गया\" carries a more negative emotional weight compared to your proposed translation. It suggests a sinking or deflating feeling, akin to a sense of dejection or despondency, rather than a calming or peaceful state.\n\n4. Idiomatic expression: While \"दिल बैठ गया\" is an established idiomatic expression in Hindi, it is distinct from phrases that convey a sense of inner tranquility or contentment. It is more closely aligned with expressions that indicate a decline in emotional well-being, such as \"दिल टूट गया\" (my heart broke) or \"दिल दुखी हो गया\" (my heart became sad).\n\nTherefore, based on the literal meaning, contextual usage, and idiomatic nature of the phrase, I believe the correct English translation of \"दिल बैठ गया\" is \"My heart sank\" or \"My heart fell.\" This translation better captures the emotional nuance and connotation of the Hindi phrase.
