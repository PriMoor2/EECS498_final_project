The Hindi word \"दिमाग\" directly translates to \"mind\" in English. So the subject of the sentence is referring to someone's mental state.\n\n2. The Hindi word \"खराब\" means \"disturbed, unsound, or impaired.\" This conveys the idea that the person's mental state is not normal or healthy.\n\n3. The structure \"उसका दिमाग खराब है\" follows the typical subject-verb-adjective pattern in Hindi, which directly translates to \"His mind is disturbed/unsound\" in English.\n\n4. This translation captures the intended meaning of the Hindi text, which is to communicate that the person's mental faculties are not functioning properly or are in a disturbed state.\n\nI believe this translation accurately conveys the essence of the original Hindi statement.

While I understand your perspective, I respectfully disagree and believe the correct English translation of the Hindi text \"उसका दिमाग खराब है\" is:\n\n\"His mind is damaged/impaired.\"\n\nHere are my reasons for this translation:\n\n1. The word \"खराब\" in Hindi can be more accurately translated as \"damaged\" or \"impaired\" rather than just \"disturbed\" or \"unsound.\" The connotation is that there is a more severe, permanent issue with the person's mental state.\n\n2. The phrase \"उसका दिमाग खराब है\" suggests a more clinical or medical condition, implying that the person's mind or cognitive abilities are impaired, not just temporarily disturbed.\n\n3. Using the word \"damaged\" or \"impaired\" conveys a stronger sense of the mental state being compromised or dysfunctional, rather than just being in a disturbed or unsound condition.\n\n4.
