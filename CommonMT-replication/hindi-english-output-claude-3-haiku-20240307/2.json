Literal meaning: The Hindi phrase \"उसका हाथ साफ़ है\" translates directly to \"His/Her hand is clean\" in English. The use of the singular \"hand\" in the Hindi text indicates that it is referring to a single hand, rather than both hands.\n\n2. Contextual understanding: In Hindi, the use of the singular \"hand\" is often used idiomatically to represent the person as a whole. So \"उसका हाथ साफ़ है\" conveys the meaning that the person's hands, and by extension the person themselves, are clean or free from wrongdoing.\n\n3. Idiomatic expression: The English phrase \"His/Her hands are clean\" is a common idiomatic expression that conveys the same meaning as the Hindi text - that the person is honest, ethical, and not involved in any improper or illegal activities.\n\nTherefore, based on the literal translation, contextual usage, and idiomatic equivalence, I firmly believe that the most accurate English translation of \"उसका हाथ साफ़ है\" is \"His/Her hands are clean.\" Thank you."
