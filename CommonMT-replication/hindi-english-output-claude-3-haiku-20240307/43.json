The use of 'two feet' rather than just 'feet' better captures the nuance of self-reliance and independence conveyed in the original Hindi phrase. Additionally, the English idiom 'to stand on one's own two feet' is more widely recognized and natural-sounding than 'to stand on one's own feet'.",

Idiomatic meaning: In Hindi, the phrase \"अपने ही पैरों पर खड़ा है\" is an idiomatic expression that conveys the idea of being self-reliant, independent, and able to support oneself without relying on others.
