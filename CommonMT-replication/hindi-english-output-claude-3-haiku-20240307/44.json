    "debate_translation": "heartache or heartbreak",
    "Reason": "While both sides have presented compelling arguments, I believe the affirmative side has provided a stronger case for the translation of 'दिल जलना' as 'heartache' or 'heartbreak.' The affirmative side has demonstrated that these English terms more accurately capture the nuanced emotional meaning and connotations of the Hindi phrase, which conveys a sense of deep emotional distress and anguish within the heart. The literal translation of 'heart burning' does not fully capture this emotional essence, and could be interpreted more literally. 'Heartache' and 'heartbreak' are more idiomatic and better reflect the intended meaning of the Hindi expression.",
