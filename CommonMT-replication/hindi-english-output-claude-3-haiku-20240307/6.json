Literal meaning: The Hindi phrase \"आकाश छू लिया\" literally translates to \"touched the sky.\" This suggests a physical action of reaching or attaining something that is high up, rather than just a metaphorical touching.\n\n2. Contextual usage: In Hindi, this phrase is commonly used to describe someone who has achieved an extraordinary feat or accomplishment, often beyond normal human capabilities. The emphasis is on the person reaching or attaining a lofty goal, not just metaphorically touching it.\n\n3. Nuance in meaning: The word \"touch\" in English can have a more passive or superficial connotation, whereas \"reach\" better captures the sense of actively striving for and attaining a high level of achievement.\n\n4. Idiomatic translation: Many idiomatic Hindi expressions do not translate directly to English word-for-word. In this case, \"reach the sky\" is a more accurate and natural English idiom that conveys the intended meaning.\n\nTherefore, I believe that \"He/She reached the sky\" is a more precise and contextually appropriate translation of the given Hindi phrase.
