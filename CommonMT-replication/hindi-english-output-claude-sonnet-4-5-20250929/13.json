Key strengths include: (1) Acknowledging the gender-neutral nature of 'वह' and suggesting 'They' as a more inclusive option in modern English; (2) Establishing a clear preference hierarchy among the three translations with linguistic justification; (3) Better explaining why 'He has gone' most accurately captures the perfective aspect and present relevance implied by the compound verb 'चला गया'; (4) Addressing the temporal ambiguity that the present perfect tense better preserves. The Negative side's refinement that 'He has gone' should be the primary translation due to its superior aspectual match with the Hindi compound verb structure is linguistically sound. The completive aspect in 'चला गया' emphasizes not just the past action but its current relevance (he is absent now), which the present perfect captures more precisely than simple past.",
