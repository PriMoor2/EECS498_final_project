    "Reason": "After evaluating both translations, I support the Affirmative side's translation 'He speaks loudly' for the following reasons: 1) ACCURACY: The most direct and common interpretation of 'ऊँचा बोलता है' refers to speaking with high volume. While the Negative side raises valid points about potential idiomatic usage, the literal meaning of 'ऊँचा' (high/loud) + 'बोलता है' (speaks) most naturally refers to volume in standard Hindi. 2) FLUENCY: 'He speaks loudly' is perfectly natural and idiomatic in English. The Negative side's alternatives ('speaks highly' or 'speaks arrogantly') are less directly supported by the Hindi text without additional contextual markers. 3) LINGUISTIC EVIDENCE: While 'ज़ोर से बोलना' is indeed common for 'speak loudly,' 'ऊँचा बोलना' is also legitimately used to describe loud speech. The Negative side's idiomatic interpretation, while possible in certain contexts, requires additional contextual clues that are absent here. 4) DEFAULT INTERPRETATION: In the absence of specific context suggesting arrogance or boastfulness, the default interpretation of 'ऊँचा बोलता है' should be the literal one referring to volume. The burden of proof for the idiomatic interpretation lies with demonstrating contextual necessity, which the Negative side has not established beyond theoretical possibility.",
