The Affirmative side's conflation of these two concepts is a fundamental error.\n\n2. **Semantic Precision**: The English word 'shaken' carries a strong implication of external agency ('was shaken by something/someone'), which is not inherently present in 'हिल गया'. The Negative side's translation 'moved' is more neutral and accurately represents the intransitive nature without adding implications not present in the source text.\n\n3. **Natural Usage**: The Negative side provides compelling examples of how 'हिल गया' is used in everyday Hindi, demonstrating that 'moved' or 'shifted' are more natural equivalents across various contexts.\n\n4. **Fluency**: While both translations are fluent, 'moved' is more versatile and natural in English for describing both voluntary and involuntary displacement without the passive voice baggage that 'was shaken' carries.\n\nThe Affirmative side makes valid points about involuntary action, but incorrectly assumes this requires passive voice in English.

It shows the action happened and reached completion.\n\n### 2. **\"Shaken\" Implies External Agency**\nYour translation \"was shaken\" in English **strongly implies an external agent**:\n- \"He was shaken\" → Someone/something shook him\n- This would be \"उसे हिलाया गया\" in Hindi\n\n\"हिल गया\" describes the subject's own state change, whether voluntary or involuntary, **without emphasizing external causation**.\n\n### 3. **Natural Hindi Usage**\nIn everyday Hindi:\n- \"भूकंप में सब कुछ हिल गया\" = \"Everything moved in the earthquake\" (not \"was shaken\")\n- \"दरवाज़ा हिल गया\" = \"The door moved/shifted\" (not \"was shaken\")\n- \"वह अपनी जगह से हिल गया\" = \"He moved from his place\"\n\n### 4. **Emotional Context Consideration**\nEven in emotional contexts:\n- \"वह भावनात्मक रूप से हिल गया\" = \"He was emotionally moved/stirred\"\n- But standalone \"वह हिल गया\" more naturally means physical movement\n\n### 5. **Better Alternatives to \"Shaken\"**\nIf external force is contextually clear:\n- \"He got displaced\"\n- \"He was jolted\"\n- \"He shifted\"\n\n**Conclusion: \"He/She/It moved\" is the most accurate, neutral translation that preserves the intransitive nature without adding the passive implication that \"shaken\" carries in English.**"
