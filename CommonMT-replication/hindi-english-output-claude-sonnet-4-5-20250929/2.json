The established English idiom is 'to have clean hands' (plural), not 'clean hand' (singular). The Negative side correctly prioritizes natural target language expression while maintaining semantic accuracy. In translation theory, when dealing with idioms, the translator must render the expression in a way that sounds natural and idiomatic in the target language, even if this means departing from the literal grammatical structure of the source.
