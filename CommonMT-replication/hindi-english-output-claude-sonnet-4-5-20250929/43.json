    "Reason": "After careful evaluation of both translations against the criteria of accuracy and fluency, I find the Negative side's translation 'He stands on his own two feet' to be superior. Here's why: (1) ACCURACY: Both translations accurately convey the core meaning of self-reliance and independence. However, the Negative side's translation preserves the metaphorical structure of the original Hindi idiom, which is a crucial element of the source text. The phrase 'अपने पैरों पर खड़ा होना' deliberately uses physical imagery, and this stylistic choice should be honored in translation when an equivalent exists in the target language. (2) FLUENCY: The Negative side correctly identifies that 'to stand on one's own two feet' is an established English idiom that is natural, widely recognized, and commonly used by native speakers. This is documented in major English dictionaries and appears frequently in everyday speech and writing. While 'self-reliant' and 'independent' are fluent, they represent a semantic translation that sacrifices the vivid imagery and idiomatic character of the original. The Negative side's translation achieves both naturalness in English AND fidelity to the source text's stylistic features. The addition of 'two' makes it perfectly idiomatic in English. The Affirmative side's concern about literal translation is valid in general, but doesn't apply here since English possesses the same idiom with the same meaning.",

Native speakers would more naturally say:\n- \"He is self-reliant\"\n- \"He is independent\"\n- \"He stands on his own two feet\" (if using the literal idiom)\n\n### 4. **Context Appropriateness**\nThis translation works across various contexts—whether discussing someone who:\n- Has started earning their own living\n- No longer depends on parents\n- Has achieved financial stability\n- Is self-sufficient in life\n\n**My position:** The idiomatic translation is superior to the literal one for effective cross-cultural communication."
