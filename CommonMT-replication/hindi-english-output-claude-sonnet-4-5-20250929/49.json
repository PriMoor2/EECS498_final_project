    "Reason": "After careful evaluation of both positions, I find the Negative side's argument more compelling for several critical reasons:\n\n1. **Semantic Accuracy**: The Negative side correctly identifies that 'पेट में चूहे कूदना' primarily denotes extreme hunger (with stomach growling/rumbling), while 'butterflies in the stomach' in English primarily conveys nervous excitement or anxiety, rarely hunger. This is a fundamental semantic mismatch that the Affirmative side overlooks.\n\n2. **Context Dependency**: Without additional context in the source text, we cannot determine whether the speaker is hungry or anxious. The Affirmative side makes an assumption by choosing 'butterflies,' which narrows the meaning inappropriately. The Negative side acknowledges this ambiguity.\n\n3. **Cultural Preservation**: The imagery of 'rats/mice jumping' carries different connotations than 'butterflies' - it suggests more intense, uncomfortable sensations often associated with hunger pangs. The Affirmative's translation loses this cultural specificity.\n\n4. **Translation Principle**: While idiomatic translation is valuable, it should not come at the cost of accuracy. The Negative side's approach of providing literal translation with contextual explanation, or context-dependent options, better serves translation fidelity.\n\n5. **Fluency vs. Accuracy Trade-off**: While the Affirmative's translation is more fluent in English, it sacrifices accuracy. The Negative side appropriately prioritizes accuracy while still offering fluent alternatives based on context.\n\nThe Negative side demonstrates a more nuanced understanding of translation challenges and offers more faithful solutions.",

A literal translation preserves the ambiguity.\n\n### 3. **Loss of Cultural Imagery**\nYour approach erases the specific cultural metaphor. \"Rats/mice\" jumping conveys:\n- More aggressive, uncomfortable sensation\n- Often associated with hunger pangs specifically\n- Different cultural resonance than gentle \"butterflies\"\n\n### 4. **Translation Fidelity**\nIn academic or literary translation, preserving the source language's imagery can be important. Consider:\n- **Literal with explanation**: \"Rats are jumping in his/her stomach (meaning he/she is very hungry/anxious)\"\n- This maintains cultural authenticity while ensuring comprehension\n\n### 5. **\"Butterflies\" Is Too Narrow**\nYour translation forces ONE interpretation when the Hindi allows multiple. This is **overtranslation** - adding specificity that isn't in the original.\n\n**Therefore, a literal translation with contextual notes, or a context-dependent idiomatic translation, would be more accurate than defaulting to \"butterflies in the stomach.\"**"
