    "Reason": "The negative side presents a more grammatically precise argument. While the affirmative side correctly identifies that 'वह' (vah) can be gender-neutral in isolation, they fail to give sufficient weight to the verb agreement system in Hindi. The verb form 'गया' (gaya) is explicitly masculine, and in Hindi grammar, past tense verbs must agree with the gender of the subject. If the subject were feminine, the sentence would necessarily be 'वह ऊपर गई' (vah oopar gayi). The negative side correctly points out that the pronoun-verb agreement system exists precisely to resolve such ambiguities. While the affirmative side mentions that grammatical gender doesn't always determine biological gender, this principle applies primarily to nouns, not to pronoun-verb constructions where agreement is mandatory and definitive. The masculine verb form 'गया' grammatically determines that the subject is masculine, making 'He went up' the accurate translation. Both translations achieve high fluency, but the negative side's translation is more accurate as it respects the grammatical gender agreement present in the source text.",
