    "Reason": "After careful evaluation of both positions, I support the Affirmative side's translation 'He/She touched the sky' for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Accuracy**: The Affirmative translation maintains perfect literal accuracy while preserving the idiomatic meaning. The phrase 'touch the sky' is indeed a recognized English idiom that conveys achievement and success.\n\n2. **Idiomatic Validity**: While the Negative side argues that 'reach for the stars' is more common, 'touch the sky' is equally valid and widely used in English. Examples include songs ('Touch the Sky' by Kanye West), literature, and common speech. The claim that it's 'less idiomatic' is not sufficiently supported.\n\n3. **Perfective Aspect**: The Negative side's concern about 'छू लिया' is addressed by the past tense 'touched,' which clearly indicates completed action. The perfective aspect is adequately captured.\n\n4. **Direct Correspondence**: The Affirmative translation maintains the exact metaphorical imagery (sky/आकाश) used in the original, which is important for preserving the author's intended expression. Changing 'sky' to 'stars' alters the original metaphor.\n\n5. **Fluency**: 'Touched the sky' is natural, poetic, and fluent in English. It doesn't sound awkward or require explanation.\n\nWhile 'reached for the stars' is a valid alternative idiom, it changes the source imagery and is not necessary when a direct, accurate, and fluent translation exists.",
