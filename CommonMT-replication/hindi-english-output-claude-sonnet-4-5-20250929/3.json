    "debate_translation": "He fell up",
    "Reason": "After careful evaluation of both positions, I support the Negative side's translation 'He fell up/upward.' Here are my reasons: 1) ACCURACY: The Negative side provides a more accurate literal translation. The Hindi text explicitly uses 'ऊपर' (up/upward), not 'नीचे' (down). If the speaker intended 'down,' they had a clear and common word available. 2) TRANSLATION FIDELITY: The Affirmative side's argument relies heavily on assuming this is an idiomatic expression, but they provide no authoritative evidence that 'ऊपर गिर गया' is a recognized idiom in Hindi. The Negative side correctly points out this is not documented as a standard idiom. 3) RESPECTING SOURCE TEXT: Translation should preserve what was actually said. The Affirmative side's approach of 'correcting' the text based on physical assumptions (gravity) oversteps the translator's role. There are plausible contexts where 'fell up' makes sense (falling upward on stairs, stumbling forward and upward while climbing). 4) FLUENCY CONSIDERATION: While 'He fell down' is more natural in isolation, 'He fell up' is grammatically correct and comprehensible English. The slight awkwardness may actually reflect an unusual situation described in the original. Without additional context proving this is idiomatic usage, we must prioritize accuracy over assumed naturalness.",

When someone falls, they fall *down*, not up. This physical reality overrides the literal meaning of \"ऊपर.\"\n\n### 3. **Contextual Interpretation**\nWithout additional context suggesting an unusual scenario (like falling upward in zero gravity or being thrown upward), the most natural and common interpretation is a standard fall, which is downward.\n\n### 4. **Common Hindi Expression**\nNative Hindi speakers often use \"ऊपर गिर गया\" interchangeably with \"नीचे गिर गया\" (fell down) in everyday conversation, particularly in certain regional dialects.\n\n### 5. **Translation Priority**\nGood translation prioritizes **meaning and natural usage** over word-for-word literal translation. \"He fell down\" conveys what a Hindi speaker would typically mean by this phrase.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The correct English translation is **\"He fell down\"** because it captures the intended meaning of the Hindi phrase in natural, idiomatic English."
