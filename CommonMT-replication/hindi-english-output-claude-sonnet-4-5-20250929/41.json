While the Affirmative side provides a thorough analysis of most elements of the translation, they overlook a critical grammatical feature of Hindi: gender agreement in past tense verbs. The verb 'बोला' (bola) is unambiguously masculine in form. If the subject were feminine, the verb would be 'बोली' (boli). This is not a matter of ambiguity or context—it is a definitive grammatical marker in Hindi. The Negative side correctly identifies this error while acknowledging the accuracy of the rest of the Affirmative's translation. In terms of accuracy, which is our primary criterion, the Negative side's translation is more precise because it correctly reflects the grammatical gender indicated by the verb form. Both sides agree on the translation of 'हल्की आवाज़ में' and offer equally fluent English renderings ('in a soft voice' or 'softly').
