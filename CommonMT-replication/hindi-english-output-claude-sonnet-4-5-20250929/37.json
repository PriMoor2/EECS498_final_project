    "Reason": "Both translations demonstrate strong understanding of the source text, but the Negative side's argument for 'His/Her head is empty' is more compelling for several reasons: (1) Idiomatic strength - 'empty head' and 'empty-headed' are more established and frequently used English idioms than 'empty mind' when describing lack of intelligence or ideas. (2) Tone matching - The colloquial and slightly derogatory nature of 'उसका दिमाग ख़ाली है' is better captured by 'head is empty' which sounds more casual and dismissive, whereas 'mind is empty' carries a more philosophical or meditative connotation that doesn't match the original intent. (3) Natural usage - Native English speakers more commonly say 'nothing in their head' or 'empty-headed' rather than 'empty mind' in everyday conversation. (4) Functional equivalence - 'Head' serves as the perfect bridge between physical and mental aspects, just as 'दिमाग' does in Hindi. While 'mind is empty' is grammatically correct and semantically accurate, 'head is empty' achieves superior fluency and better captures the pragmatic meaning of the original Hindi expression.",
