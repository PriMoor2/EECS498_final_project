The Negative side makes compelling points about: (1) the casual and temporary nature of how this phrase is often used in Hindi, (2) the literal meaning of 'खराब' suggesting malfunction rather than permanent insanity, and (3) the need to preserve contextual flexibility. The phrase 'उसका दिमाग खराब है' can range from mild criticism ('he's being foolish') to serious concern ('he has mental issues'), and the translation should accommodate this range. In terms of accuracy, the Negative side's translations better preserve the semantic range of the original.

Your translation loses this mechanical/functional aspect.\n\n### 3. **Context Flexibility**\n\"दिमाग खराब है\" can mean:\n- Someone made a poor decision (temporary lapse)\n- Someone is acting strangely today (situational)\n- Someone is annoying me with their behavior (frustration)\n- Someone has actual mental health issues (serious)\n\nYour translation **locks us into only the most extreme interpretation**.\n\n### 4. **Better Alternatives**\nMore accurate translations that preserve flexibility:\n- \"Something is wrong with his/her mind\"\n- \"He/She isn't thinking straight\"\n- \"His/her head isn't right\"\n- \"He/She has gone mad\" (if context is clearly extreme)\n\n### 5. **Colloquial Usage**\nIn everyday Hindi conversation, people say \"तेरा दिमाग खराब है क्या?\" (Is your mind broken?) when someone does something merely **foolish or annoying** - not necessarily \"crazy.\"\n\n**My Conclusion:** Translation requires preserving both meaning AND register.
