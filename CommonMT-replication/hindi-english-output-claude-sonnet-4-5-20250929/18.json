    "Reason": "Both debaters present compelling arguments, but the Affirmative side's translation is superior for this context. Here's why: (1) Accuracy: While the Negative side correctly points out that 'His/Her heart is big' preserves structural fidelity, the Affirmative's 'He/She has a big heart' more accurately captures the idiomatic meaning in Hindi. The phrase 'उसका दिल बड़ा है' is itself an idiom in Hindi used to describe someone's generous nature, not a literal description. Translating idiom to idiom ('big heart' to 'big heart') maintains semantic accuracy. (2) Fluency: 'He/She has a big heart' is the standard, natural English expression. While 'His/Her heart is big' is grammatically correct, it sounds awkward and unnatural in modern English usage. The Negative side's argument about literary contexts has merit, but without specific context indicating a poetic or archaic register, we should default to natural contemporary usage. (3) Translation Philosophy: The Negative side's distinction between translation and localization is academic but misapplied here. Good translation balances fidelity with naturalness. When both languages share the same metaphorical idiom, using the target language's natural construction is not 'localization' but proper translation. The goal is to make the English reader feel what the Hindi reader feels, and 'He/She has a big heart' achieves this better.",
