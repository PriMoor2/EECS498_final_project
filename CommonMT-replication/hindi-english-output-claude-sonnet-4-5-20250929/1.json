    "Reason": "After careful evaluation of both positions, I support the Affirmative side's translation 'Will not come tomorrow' (or 'Won't come tomorrow'). Here are my reasons: 1) ACCURACY: While the Negative side makes an interesting linguistic argument about word order, the most common and natural interpretation of 'कल नहीं आएगा' in everyday Hindi usage refers to someone/something not coming tomorrow, not to the philosophical concept of tomorrow itself not arriving. The Affirmative's interpretation aligns with standard conversational usage. 2) CONTEXTUAL PROBABILITY: The Negative side's interpretation 'Tomorrow will not come' is grammatically possible but represents a highly marked, poetic, or philosophical reading that would typically require additional context to be the intended meaning. Without such context, the default interpretation should be the more common one. 3) FLUENCY: The Affirmative's translation is more natural in English for everyday communication. While both are grammatically correct English sentences, 'Won't come tomorrow' is the interpretation that would be understood in typical conversational contexts. 4) SUBJECT OMISSION: The Affirmative correctly identifies that Hindi frequently omits subjects when they're understood from context, which is a key feature of the language. The Negative side's argument that 'कल' must be the subject because it appears first is not conclusive, as Hindi word order is more flexible than English, and time expressions commonly appear sentence-initially as adverbials. The Negative side's argument about verb agreement with 'कल' being masculine is creative but doesn't override the more common interpretation.",

The verb conjugation \"आएगा\" tells us:\n- It's future tense\n- It's masculine gender\n- It's singular number\n\nTherefore, the implied subject could be \"he,\" \"it,\" or any masculine singular entity.\n\n### 3. **Natural English Translation**\nWhile we could add \"(He/She/It)\" in parentheses for clarity, the most natural and accurate translation maintains the same implicit subject structure: **\"Will not come tomorrow\"**\n\nThis is perfectly acceptable English in conversational contexts where the subject is already known to both speaker and listener.\n\n### 4. **Context Dependency**\nThe beauty of this translation is that it preserves the original's ambiguity—which is intentional in Hindi. Adding an explicit subject would be over-translating unless the context demands it.\n\n**I'm ready to defend this position in our debate!**"

I believe the correct English translation is:\n\n**\"Tomorrow will not come\"** or **\"Tomorrow won't come\"**\n\n## My Reasoning\n\n### 1. **Word Order Matters in Translation**\n\nThe Hindi phrase \"कल नहीं आएगा\" follows this structure:\n- **कल** (kal) = tomorrow (subject position)\n- **नहीं** (nahin) = not\n- **आएगा** (aayega) = will come\n\nIn Hindi, **कल appears in the subject position** at the beginning of the sentence. When a time word occupies the subject position, it often functions as the grammatical subject, not as an adverbial modifier.\n\n### 2. **Semantic Interpretation**\n\nYour translation \"Will not come tomorrow\" implies:\n- Someone/something (unstated) will not arrive on the day called tomorrow\n- Tomorrow is merely a time reference\n\nMy translation \"Tomorrow will not come\" implies:\n- The day itself (tomorrow) will not arrive\n- This is a philosophical or poetic statement about time\n\n### 3. **Context Clues from Verb Agreement**\n\nYou correctly noted that **आएगा** is masculine singular. Interestingly, in Hindi:\n- **कल (tomorrow)** is treated as **masculine** when used as a noun/subject\n- This verb agreement supports \"tomorrow\" as the subject\n\nIf the intended meaning were \"he/she won't come tomorrow,\" the more natural Hindi would be:\n- \"वह कल नहीं आएगा\" (vah kal nahin aayega) - with explicit subject \"वह\"\n\n### 4. **The Ambiguity Argument**\n\nYou're right that context matters, but **the placement of कल at the beginning suggests it's the subject**, not an adverbial. Without additional context indicating otherwise, the grammatically primary reading is \"Tomorrow will not come.\"\n\n**I'm ready to hear your rebuttal!**"
