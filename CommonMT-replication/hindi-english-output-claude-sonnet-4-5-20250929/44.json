    "Reason": "Both debaters demonstrate strong understanding of the idiom, but the Negative side presents a more comprehensive analysis. The Affirmative side correctly identifies jealousy/envy as a primary meaning but limits the translation too narrowly. The Negative side successfully argues that: (1) 'दिल जलना' encompasses a broader emotional spectrum including resentment, hurt, and bitterness, not just jealousy; (2) The burning metaphor carries significant emotional intensity that should be preserved in translation; (3) Context determines the specific shade of meaning; (4) The example 'मेरी बेइज्जती से मेरा दिल जल गया' effectively demonstrates that the phrase can express hurt/resentment rather than jealousy. The Negative side also correctly rejects 'heartburn' as misleading. In terms of accuracy, the Negative translation better captures the full semantic range of the original phrase. For fluency, 'to burn with jealousy/resentment' or 'to feel deeply hurt/envious' maintains naturalness while preserving the metaphorical intensity.",
