    "Reason": "Both debaters present valid linguistic arguments, but the Negative side provides a more comprehensive analysis. While the Affirmative correctly identifies that 'बड़ा' is masculine, they make an unwarranted leap in assuming this necessarily indicates a male person. The Negative side effectively demonstrates that: (1) 'वह' functions primarily as a demonstrative pronoun meaning 'that' in Hindi, (2) grammatical gender in Hindi applies to all nouns, not just people, so masculine 'बड़ा' could modify countless inanimate masculine nouns, and (3) without context, translation should preserve ambiguity rather than add assumptions. The Affirmative's translation 'He is big' imposes a specific interpretation (male human referent) that isn't necessarily supported by the source text alone. In terms of accuracy, the Negative's translation better captures the potential meanings of the original without over-specifying. For fluency, both translations are natural English, but 'That is big' maintains the semantic openness of the Hindi text.

In Hindi, adjectives agree with the gender of the noun they modify:\n- Masculine: बड़ा (bada)\n- Feminine: बड़ी (badi)\n\nSince the text uses \"बड़ा\" (masculine), the subject \"वह\" must refer to a masculine entity, making \"He\" the most accurate translation.\n\n### 2. **\"She\" and \"It\" are Grammatically Incorrect**\n- If the subject were feminine, the sentence would be \"वह बड़ी है\"\n- If referring to an inanimate object (it), the gender would still be marked (masculine or feminine in Hindi), but \"बड़ा\" specifically indicates masculine\n\n### 3. **Context of \"Big\" vs \"Elder\"**\nWhile \"बड़ा\" can mean \"elder/older,\" without additional context suggesting age comparison or family relationships, the primary meaning is \"big\" (in size or importance). I agree with keeping \"big\" as the translation.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile your translation acknowledges the ambiguity of \"वह\" in isolation, the grammatical evidence from \"बड़ा\" clearly indicates a **masculine subject**, making \"He is big\" the most grammatically accurate translation."
