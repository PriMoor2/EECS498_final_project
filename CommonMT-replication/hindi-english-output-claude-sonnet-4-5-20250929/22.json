While the Affirmative side correctly identifies that 'भारी आवाज़' refers to voice quality rather than volume, the Negative side goes further by: (1) acknowledging that 'deep voice' is more natural in English than 'heavy voice', (2) offering contextually appropriate alternatives like 'grave voice' or 'solemn voice' that capture the emotional weight, and (3) recognizing that 'भारी' can convey intensity and emotional gravitas beyond just pitch. The Negative side's recommendation of 'He spoke in a deep voice' as the primary translation is more idiomatic and natural in English while maintaining accuracy.
