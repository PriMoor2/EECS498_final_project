The key winning arguments were: (1) Context-dependency is absolute - in an isolated sentence without conversational or situational cues, we cannot definitively determine the referent of 'वह'; (2) Preserving ambiguity - professional translation practices dictate that when the source language contains inherent ambiguity, the translation should reflect this rather than artificially resolve it; (3) Register considerations - formal and written Hindi regularly uses 'वह' for both animate and inanimate referents without additional qualifiers. The Negative side graciously conceded these points, acknowledging that while personal pronoun usage may be more common in conversational contexts, this specific translation task requires equal treatment of both valid interpretations.
