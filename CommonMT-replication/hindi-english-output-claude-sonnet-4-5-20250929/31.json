The core issue is that without additional context, we cannot definitively determine whether the original Hindi sentence describes a positive state (where 'glowing' excels) or a neutral/negative state (where 'shining' is more appropriate). Both translations are grammatically correct and semantically defensible. The choice between them depends entirely on context that is not provided in the isolated sentence.
