    "Reason": "After careful evaluation of both translations, I find the Negative side's argument more compelling for several reasons:\n\n1. **Structural Accuracy**: The Negative side correctly identifies that 'बूंद-बूंद' uses reduplication, a specific grammatical feature in Hindi. 'Drop by drop' preserves this structure, while 'every single drop' does not. Translation should ideally maintain both meaning and structural elements when possible.\n\n2. **Process vs. Result**: The original Hindi emphasizes the MANNER of counting (the repetitive, sequential process), which 'drop by drop' captures effectively. 'Every single drop' shifts focus to completeness/totality, which is an interpretation rather than a direct translation.\n\n3. **Contextual Neutrality**: Without additional context, we cannot definitively determine whether this phrase is being used literally or idiomatically. 'Drop by drop' works in both scenarios and preserves the ambiguity of the original text. The Affirmative side's translation assumes an idiomatic usage that may not be intended.\n\n4. **Translation Standards**: The Negative side correctly points out that Hindi reduplicative constructions are standardly translated using 'by' constructions in English, following established translation conventions.\n\nWhile the Affirmative side makes valid points about idiomatic weight, translation should prioritize fidelity to the source text's structure and meaning before interpretive enhancement. The Negative side's translation achieves better accuracy and fluency while maintaining the original's grammatical character.",
