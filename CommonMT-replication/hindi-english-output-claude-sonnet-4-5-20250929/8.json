    "Reason": "The Negative side presents a compelling and grammatically precise argument that addresses a critical error in the Affirmative's translation. The key issue is gender specificity: उसकी (uski) with the -ī ending is definitively the feminine possessive form meaning 'her', not 'his'. The Affirmative side incorrectly presented 'Her/His' as equally valid alternatives, which is grammatically inaccurate. The Negative side correctly identifies that उसका (uska) would be required for the masculine 'his'. Furthermore, the Negative side strengthens their argument by noting the consistent feminine grammatical chain: उसकी (feminine possessive) + आँखें (grammatically feminine noun) + खुल गईं (feminine plural verb). This grammatical precision is essential for accurate translation. While both sides agree on the dual interpretation (literal vs. idiomatic meaning), the Negative side's correction of the gender error is decisive. The Affirmative's translation lacks the grammatical accuracy required for a proper translation, making the Negative side's position superior.",
