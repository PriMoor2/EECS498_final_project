    "Reason": "The Negative side presents stronger arguments on both accuracy and fluency grounds. First, regarding fluency: 'very behind' is indeed grammatically awkward in English without a complement, while 'very far behind' is natural and idiomatic. Second, regarding accuracy: the Negative side correctly identifies that 'पीछे' (peeche) primarily conveys a sense of position or progress rather than temporal lateness. If temporal lateness were intended, Hindi would more naturally use 'देर से' (der se) or 'लेट' (late). The Affirmative's suggestion of 'very late' thus represents a semantic shift from the original. Third, the Negative side better handles the intensifier 'बहुत' (bahut) by pairing it with 'far' to create 'very far behind,' which more accurately captures the degree of distance implied. The construction 'बहुत पीछे था' most naturally refers to being behind in progress, position, or competition rather than being late for an appointment. While the Affirmative side correctly identifies the ambiguity in the original text, the Negative side provides a translation that is both more grammatically sound in English and more faithful to the most probable meaning of the Hindi phrase.",
