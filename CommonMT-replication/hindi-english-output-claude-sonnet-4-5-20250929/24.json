    "debate_translation": "His/Her face fell",
    "Reason": "Both debaters present valid arguments, but the Affirmative side's translation 'His/Her face fell' is more strongly supported. Here's why: (1) ACCURACY: Both 'face fell' and 'face dropped' accurately capture the idiomatic meaning of disappointment/dejection in 'उसका चेहरा उतर गया'. However, 'face fell' is the more established and widely recognized English idiom that directly parallels the Hindi expression. (2) FLUENCY: 'His/Her face fell' is the standard, natural-sounding English idiom found in dictionaries and literature. While the Negative side claims 'face dropped' is more contemporary, 'face fell' remains the dominant form in both British and American English across all registers. The Negative side's claim that 'face fell' sounds archaic is not well-supported by current usage data. (3) IDIOMATIC EQUIVALENCE: The Affirmative side correctly identifies that this is an idiom-to-idiom translation, which is the gold standard in translation. The Negative side's suggestion of descriptive alternatives like 'looked crestfallen' sacrifices the idiomatic structure and adds interpretation rather than translation. (4) The Negative side's argument about 'dropped' being closer to the literal 'उतर गया' misses the point that idioms should be translated idiomatically, not literally. Overall, the Affirmative side provides a more conventional, accurate, and fluent translation.",

This provides a better bridge between the source and target languages.\n\n4. **Descriptive Alternatives Are Valid**: Translations like \"He/She looked crestfallen\" or \"His/Her expression turned gloomy\" are not \"moving away\" from the original—they're providing clearer, more explicit translations that ensure the emotional content is unmistakably conveyed, especially for readers unfamiliar with the idiom.\n\n5. **Context Matters**: Without knowing the full context of the sentence, we should consider that \"उसका चेहरा उतर गया\" might require a more descriptive translation depending on the register, audience, and surrounding text.\n\n**Conclusion**: While \"face fell\" is acceptable, \"face dropped\" or descriptive alternatives better capture the nuance and are more aligned with contemporary English usage.\n\nYour rebuttal?"
