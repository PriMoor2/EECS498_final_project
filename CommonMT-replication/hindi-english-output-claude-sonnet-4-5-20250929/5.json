The idiomatic translation 'Something is fishy' accurately captures the intended meaning that would be understood by the original Hindi speaker. The Negative side's literal translation 'There's something black in the lentils' fails the accuracy test because it does not convey the actual meaning - no Hindi speaker uses this phrase to literally discuss lentils. 2) FLUENCY: 'Something is fishy' is natural, idiomatic English that flows well and is immediately understood by English speakers. The literal translation is awkward and confusing without explanation, requiring additional context or footnotes, which diminishes fluency. 3) TRANSLATION PURPOSE: While the Negative side raises valid theoretical points about foreignization vs. domestication, they acknowledge we lack specific context. In the absence of special circumstances (like a language textbook explicitly teaching idioms), the default translation goal should be to convey meaning naturally. The Affirmative's approach achieves this. 4) The Negative side's argument essentially concedes that 'something is fishy' is valid but argues for context-dependency. However, their alternative requires explanatory notes, which suggests the translation itself is insufficient. A good translation should stand on its own merit.
