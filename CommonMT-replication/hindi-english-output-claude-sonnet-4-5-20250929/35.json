The key points that sway my judgment are: (1) 'चलना' has 'to walk' as its primary, literal meaning, with 'to go' being a contextual extension; (2) Without additional context (destination, direction, or departure cues), 'He is walking' is more semantically complete and requires fewer assumptions; (3) The Negative side correctly points out that 'He is going' in English typically implies a destination, which is absent in the source text; (4) Translation best practices favor the most literal and common usage when context is absent. The Negative side doesn't reject 'He is going' entirely but appropriately positions it as a secondary, context-dependent alternative.

While it can mean \"to go\" in certain contexts, this is a **derived or extended meaning**. When translating without context, we should prefer the primary lexical meaning. \n\n- Primary: चलना = to walk (physical act of walking)\n- Secondary/Contextual: चलना = to go/move/leave\n\n### 2. **\"Going\" Requires Additional Context**\nYour claim that both are \"equally valid\" overlooks an important distinction:\n- \"He is walking\" stands alone and is complete\n- \"He is going\" typically requires a destination or direction in English (\"going where?\")\n\nIn Hindi, when \"चलना\" means \"to go\" in the sense of departing or going somewhere, it's often accompanied by:\n- A destination marker: \"वह स्कूल चल रहा है\" (He is going to school)\n- Contextual cues suggesting departure\n- Or the phrase \"चला जा रहा है\" for emphasis on leaving\n\n### 3. **Translation Hierarchy Principle**\nWithout disambiguating context, translation best practices dictate we should choose:\n1.
