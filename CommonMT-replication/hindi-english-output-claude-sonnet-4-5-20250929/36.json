The Negative side makes a crucial point that 'खाली' has dual meanings in Hindi - not just 'empty' but also 'free/available/unoccupied' when referring to people. This is a common usage in everyday Hindi conversation (e.g., 'क्या वह खाली है?' meaning 'Is he/she free?'). Without additional context, all four translations (It/That/He/She is empty) are equally valid grammatically and semantically. The Negative side's translation is more accurate because it acknowledges the genuine ambiguity of the source text and doesn't prematurely narrow down possibilities based on assumed probability.
