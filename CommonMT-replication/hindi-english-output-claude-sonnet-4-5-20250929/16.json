    "Reason": "After careful evaluation of both translations, I find the Negative side's argument more compelling. While both 'I am feeling cold' and 'I feel cold' are grammatically correct and convey the meaning accurately, the Negative side makes a stronger case for 'I feel cold' being the more natural and idiomatic English translation. The key points that influenced this decision are: (1) In English, physical sensations are typically expressed using simple present tense rather than present continuous - this is standard usage among native speakers; (2) The continuous aspect in Hindi ('लग रही है') does not necessitate a continuous form in English, as Hindi employs continuous tenses more broadly than English; (3) The Negative side correctly identifies that similar Hindi constructions with sensory verbs are standardly translated using simple present in English (e.g., 'I feel hungry' rather than 'I am feeling hungry'); (4) While the Affirmative side's translation is not incorrect, it sounds slightly marked or emphatic in English, whereas 'I feel cold' is the unmarked, default expression. In terms of the evaluation criteria: both translations score equally on Accuracy (both capture the original meaning), but 'I feel cold' scores higher on Fluency due to its more natural and idiomatic quality in English.",
